Monopoly Rules 
 
HISTO RY… PARKER BRO THERS Real  Estate Tr ading G ame MONOPOLY© was invented dur ing th e Great Depression  by Charles 
B. Darrow of Germ antown Pennsylvania. Mr. Dar row, like. many other Am ericans, was unem ployed at  the tim e and he work ed ou t the 
details of the game primarily to amuse hi mself during this period. Prior to the Depression, Darrow and his wife vacat ioned in the resort 
town of Atlantic City, New  Jersey. Whe n it came to nam ing the streets on the game boar d, Darrow naturally adopt ed those of his favorite 
vacat ion spot. 
The first games were handmade. Darrow gave them to friends and sold a few through a Philadelphia department store. As  the dem and for 
the gam e grew, Darrow could not keep up with the orders and arranged for Parker Brothers to take over the game. 
Since 1935 when Pa rker Brothers acquired the rights to the gam e, it has becom e the leading proprietary gam e not only in the United States 
but throughout the West ern world. the game is published under license i n twenty&SHY;five countries and in fifteen foreign languages. 
 
OBJECT ...The object of the  game is to be come the wealthiest player through buying, re nting and selling prope rty. 
 
EQUIPMENT ...The equipment consists of  a boa rd, 2 dice, tokens 32 houses and 12 hotels. T here are Cha nce and Com munity Chest 
cards, a Title Deed card for each property and play money. 
 
PREP ARATION...Place t he board on a tabl e and put the Chance and C ommunity Chest cards face-down on t heir all otted s paces on the 
board. Eac h player ch ooses one token to represent  him on hi s travels around the board. 
 
Each player is given $1500 divided as follows: 2 each of $500's, $100's and $50's; 6-$20's; 5 eac h of $10's, $5's and $1's. 
All remaining money  and other equipment go to the Bank. 
 
BANKE R...Select as Ban ker a player who will also  make a good Auction eer. If the Ban ker plays in  the game, he must keep h is personal 
funds separat e from those of the Bank. Whe n more than five persons play, the Ba nker may elect to act only as Banke r and Auction eer. 
 
THE BANK ...Besid es the Ban k's money, the Bank  holds the Title Deed  cards and  houses and  hotels prio r to purchase and use by the 
players. The Ban k pays salari es and  bonuses. It sells and  aucti ons properties and  hands out their prop er Title Deed  card s; it s ells hou ses 
and hotels to the players a nd loans money  when required on mortgages. 
 
The Ban k collects all tax es, fines, loans and interest, an d the price of all properties wh ich it sells an d auctions.  
 
The Ban k never "go es brok e". If th e Bank  runs out of m oney it may issue as m uch more as m ay be needed  by merely writing  on any 
ordinary paper. 
 
THE PLAY ... Startin g with th e Ban ker, each  player in turn th rows th e dice. Th e player with the highest to tal starts th e play. He places his 
token on the corne r marked " GO", throws  the 2 dice a nd move s his token in the direction of the  arrow t he number of spaces i ndicated by 
the dice. After he has completed his play, the turn t o play pa sses to t he left. The  tokens remain on the  spaces occ upied and pr oceed from  
that point on the player' s next turn. T wo or more  tokens  may rest on the same space at the  same time. 
 
According to the space which his t oken reaches, a player may be e ntitled to buy real es tate or other properties, -or be  obliged  to pay rent, 
pay taxes, draw a Chance or Community Chest  card, "Go to Jail", etc. 
 
If a player throws doubles he moves hi s token as usual the sum of the two dice an d is subject to any privileges o r penal ties pertaini ng to 
the space on which he la nds. Retaining t he dice, he t hrows again and moves his t oken as before . If a player throws doubles thre e tim es in 
successi on, he moves hi s token immediately to the space  marked "In Jail" (see J AIL). 
 
"GO" ...Eac h time a player' s toke n lands on or pass es over "GO" , whet her by thr ow of the dice or by drawing a ca rd, the Banker pays him  
$200 salar y.

Howe ver, $200 is paid only once  each tim e around the  board. If a  player, passi ng "GO"  on the t hrow of the dice, la nds 2 spaces beyond it 
on "Comm unity Chest", or 7 spaces beyond it on "C hance", and draws t he card "Advance to  GO", he collects $200 for passing " GO" the 
first tim e and another $20 0 for reach ing it the second  time by instruction s on the card . 
 
BUYI NG PROPERT Y...Whene ver a player lands on an unowned property he m ay buy that property from the Bank at its printed price. 
He receives t he Title Deed ca rd showing owners hip and places it face-up i n front of him.  
 
If he does not wish  to buy the prop erty it is so ld at au ction  by the Bank er to the highest bidder. Th e buyer pays to  the Bank the am ount of 
the bi d in cash and recei ves the Title Deed card for that property. Any player, i ncluding the one who declined t he option of buying it at the 
printed price, may bid. Bidding may start at any  price. 
 
PAYING R ENT...Whe n a player lands  on property owne d by anothe r player the owne r coll ects re nt from  him in accorda nce with t he list 
printed on the Title Deed  card  applying to it. 
 
If the property is mortgaged, no re nt ca n be collected. Whe n a property is mortgaged its Title Deed ca rd is placed fac e-down in  front of 
the own er. 
 
It is an adva ntage to hold all the Title Dee ds in a c olor-group  (i.e.: Boardwalk and Park Place,  - or C onnecticut, Ve rmont and Oriental 
Avenues) because the ow ner may then charge do uble rent for unimproved properties in that color-group. Thi s rule applies to unmortgage d 
properties even if another property in that colo r-group  is mo rtgaged. 
 
It is even more of an advantage to have  houses or hotels on properties because rents are m uch higher than for unimproved properties. 
 
The owner may not collect his rent if he fails to ask for it before the second player following throws the dice.  
 
"CHANCE" a nd "COMM UNITY C HEST" ...Whe n a player lands  on eithe r of these spaces  he ta kes the top ca rd from  the dec k indicated, 
follows t he instructions a nd returns the  card face-down to the bottom  of the dec k. 
 
The "Get Out of Jail Free" card is h eld until used and then returned to  the bottom of the deck . If the player who draws it d oes not wish to 
use it he m ay sell it, at any time, to anot her player at a price agreeable t o both. 
 
"INC OME TAX"...When a player lands on "Income Tax" h e has two options: he m ay estimate his tax at $200 and pay the Bank, or he 
may pay 10% of his total worth to the Bank. His total worth is all his cas h on hand, printed prices of mortgage d and unmortgaged 
properties and cost price of  all buildings he ow ns. 
 
The player m ust decide which option he will tak e before he add s up his total wo rth. 
 
JAIL ...A player lands in Jail whe n. . . (1.) hi s token lands on the  space m arked "Go to Ja il"; (2.) he draws a card m arked "Go to J ail"; (3.) 
he throws doubles three tim es in successi on.  
 
Whe n a player is sent to Jail he cannot collect $200 salary in that move since, re gardless of where his token is on the board, he must move 
it directly in to Jail. A player's tu rn ends when he is sen t to Jail. 
 
If a player is not "se nt to Jail"  but in t he ordinary c ourse of play lands on that space, he is "Just Visiting" , incurs no penalty, and m oves 
ahead  in the usual manner o n his next  turn. 
 
A player gets out of Jail by... (1.) throwi ng doubles on any of his ne xt three turns.  If he succeeds in doi ng this he immediate ly moves 
forwa rd the  num ber of spaces  shown by his doub les throw. Eve n though he has  thrown doub les he does not take another turn; (2.) using  
the "Get Out of Jail Free" card  if he has it; (3 .) purchasing the "Get Out of Jail Free" card  from another player and  playing it; (4.) payin g a 
fine of $50 before he rolls the dice on either of his next two turns 
 
If the player do es not throw doubles by his third turn he must pay the $50 fine. He then gets out of Jail and immediately moves forward 
the number of spaces shown by his  throw. 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Even thou gh he is in  Jail, a player may buy or sell pr operty, buy or sell hou ses and  hotels and  collect r ents.  
 
FREE PARKING ...A player landing on this space  does not receive  any m oney, prope rty or reward of any kind. This is  just a "free" 
restin g place. 
 
HOUSE S...When a player owns all the properties in a color & SHY; group he m ay buy houses from the Bank and erect them on those 
properties. 
 
If he buys one house, he may put it on any one of those properties. Th e next house he buys must be erected  on one of the unimproved 
properties of this or any other complete color-group he m ay own. 
 
The price he  must pay the Bank for each house is shown on his Title Dee d card for the property on whi ch he erects the house. 
 
The owner can still co llect d ouble rent from an opponent who lands on the unimproved properties of his complete co lor-g roup. 
 
Following  the above rules, a player m ay buy an d erect at an y time as m any houses as his judgment and financial stand ing will al low. Bu t 
he must bu ild evenly (i.e.: he cannot erect mo re than one house on any one prop erty of any color-gro up un til he has built o ne house on  
every  property of that group. He m ay then begin on the second row of houses, and so on, up to a limit of four houses to a property. For 
exam ple, he ca nnot build three houses on one property if he has only one house on another property of that group.). 
 
As a player builds evenly, he must also brea k down evenly if he sells houses bac k to the Bank (SEE S ELLING PROPERTY). 
 
HOTELS ...When a player has four houses on each property of a complete col or-group, he m ay buy a hotel from the Bank and erect it on 
any pro perty of that co lor-group. He returns the fou r houses f rom that property to the Bank  and pays th e price for the hotel as  shown on 
the Title Deed  card. Only one hotel m ay be erected  on any one property.  
 
BUILDI NG SHORT AGE...When the Bank has no houses to sell, players wishing to build  must wait fo r some player to  turn back or to  
sell h is hou ses to the Bank  before bu ilding. If th ere are a limited  number of houses and hotels avai lable, and two or more players wis h to 
buy more than the Bank has, the houses or hotels must be sold at auction to the highest bidder. 
 
SELLING PROPERT Y... Unimproved properties, railro ads and utilities (but not buildings) may be sold  to any player as a priv ate 
transact ion for any amount that the owner can get. However, no property can be sold to another player if buildings are standing on any 
properties of that co lor-g roup. An y buildings so located m ust be sold back to  the Bank  before th e own er can sell an y pro perty of that  
color-group. 
 
Houses  and hotels may be sol d back to t he Bank at any tim e for one-half t he price pai d for them . 
All houses on one color-group must be sold one by one, evenly, in reverse  of the manner in which they were  erect ed. 
All hotels on  one color-group may be sold at once. Or they may b e sold one house at a ti me (one hotel equals five houses) , evenly, in 
reverse of the manner in which they we re erected. 
 
MORTG AGES...Unimprove d properties can be m ortgaged through the Bank at any time. Before an improved property can be m ortgaged 
all th e buildings on  all th e prop erties of its colo r-group  must be sold back to  the Bank  at half price. T he mortgage value is p rinted on each 
Title Deed  card . 
 
No rent can be collected  on mortgaged properties or utilities , but rent can be collected  on unmortgaged prop erties in the same group. 
In order to lift the mortgage , the owner must pay the Bank the am ount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When  all the properties of a 
color-group are no  long er mortgaged the owner may begin to buy back hou ses at full price. 
 
The player who mortgages property retains possessi on of it and no other player may secure  it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank. 
However, the owner may sell this mortgage d property to another player at any agreed price. The new owner may lift the mortgage at once, 
if he wishes, by paying off the mortgage plus 10% interest to the Bank. If he does not lift the mortgage at once  he must pay the Bank 10% 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

interest wh en he bu ys th e property and  if he lifts th e mortgage later h e must pay an add itional 10% interest as well as the am ount of the 
mortgage t o the Bank. 
 
BANK RUPTCY...A player is bankrupt when he owes more than he ca n pay either to another player or to the Bank. If his debt is to 
another player, h e must turn over to that player all th at he has of value and retire from the game. In m aking this settlemen t, if he owns 
houses or hotels, he must return these to the Bank in exchange for money  to the extent of one-half the amount paid for them and this cash 
is given to the credi tor. If he has m ortgaged property he also turns this property over to his creditor but the new owner must at once pay 
the Bank the amount of interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of the property. After the new owner does this, he m ay, at his 
option, pay the prin cipal or hold the property until so me later turn at wh ich time he may lift the mortgage. If h e holds property in th is way 
until a later t urn, he must pay the interest  again when he lifts the mortgage. 
 
Should a player owe the Ban k, instead  of another player, m ore than he can pay (because of tax es or penalties) ev en by sellin g his 
buildings and mortgaging property, he m ust turn over all his asset s to the Bank. In this case, t he Bank immediately sells by auction  all 
property so taken, except buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the gam e. The l ast player left in the gam e wins. 
 
MISCELLANEOUS ...Money can only be loaned to a player by the Bank and then only by mortgaging property. No player may borr ow 
from or lend money  to another player.  
 
 
RULES for a SHORT GAME  (60 to 90 minutes of fun) T here are t hree differen ces in rules fo r this "Sho rt Gam e". 
 
1. During PREPARATION for play th e Ban ker sh uffles th e pack of Title Deed  card s. Th e pack is th en cut b y the player at his left  and the 
Banker deals, one at a tim e, two Title Deed  cards to each  player ; including himself if h e both plays and  acts as Bank er. Player s receiving 
Title Deed  card s must immediately p ay the Bank the printed price of each  of the two pro perties thu s acquired. Th e play th en commences 
as in t he regular game. 
 
2. In this short game it is o nly necessary to hav e three houses (instead  of four) on each  lot of a co mplete color-group before the player may 
buy a ho tel. 
 
Rent recei ved for a hotel rem ains the  same as in the  regular game. 
 
The turn-in value of a hotel is still o ne-half the purchase price, which in  this game is one house less t han in  the regu lar game. 
 
3. END OF GAME. The first player to go bankrupt retires from the gam e as in the regular game. However, when the second bankruptcy 
occurs t he game ends. Play immediately ceas es with the bankrupt player t urning over to  his creditor all t hat he  has of value, i ncluding 
buildings and any other properties-whether the creditor happens to be a rival player or the Bank. 
 
Each  remaining player th en values his pro perty and  cash  on hand (2.) lots, utilities an d railro ads owned by him at th e price pr inted on  the 
board; (3.) any mortgage d property owned by him at one- half price printed on the board; (4.) houses, valued at  purchase price; (5.) hotels, 
value d at the purchase price including th e value of t he thre e houses turne d in.
