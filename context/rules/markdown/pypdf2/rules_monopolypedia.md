RULES for a SHORT GAME (60-90 minutes)  
There are four changed rules for this first Short Game.
1.  During PREPARATION, the Banker shuffles then deals 
three Title Deed cards to each player. These are Free.  
No payment to the Bank is required.  
2.  You need only three Clubhouses (instead of four) on each property of a complete color group before you may buy a Playground. Playground rent remains the same. The turn-in value is still one-half of  the purchase value, which in this game is one Clubhouse less than in the regular game.  
3.  If you land in Jail you must exit on your next turn by 
(1) using a “Get Out of Jail Free” card if you have (or can buy) one;  (2) rolling doubles; or (3) paying $50. Unlike the standard rules, you may try to roll doubles and, failing to do so, pay the $50 on the same turn.SPEED PLAY RULES
PLAY IT RIGHT!
Many players like to devise their own ‘house’ MONOPOLY 
rules. This is fine, but such rules often make the game last longer. In the official rules players may never loan each other money or trade ‘promises’ not to charge rent in the future, etc. All tax and penalty fees are payable to the Bank and should not be stored under the Free Parking space or anywhere else!DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY FAST?DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY FAST?
END OF GAME:  The game ends when one player goes 
bankrupt. The remaining players add up their: (1) Dollars on 
hand; (2) properties owned, at the value printed on the 
board; (3) any mortgaged properties owned, at one-half the 
value printed on the board; (4) Clubhouses, counted at the purchase value; (5) Playgrounds, counted at purchase value including the amount for the three Clubhouses turned in.

HERE’S HOW TO PLAYHERE’S HOW TO PLAY
HOW DO I WIN?
Be the only player left in the game after 
everyone else has gone bankrupt.
Do this by: buying properties and 
charging other players rent for landing on them.
Collect groups of properties to 
increase the rent, then build Clubhouses and Playgrounds to really boost your income.
WHO GOES FIRST?
each player rolls the two dice.  
The highest roller takes the first turn.ON YOUR TURN
1. r oll the two dice.
2. Move your token clockwise around the board the number of spaces shown on the dice.
3. You will need to take action depending on which space you land on.
 See 
Where Did You 
Land?  below.
4. If your move  took you onto or past the GO space, collect $200 from the Bank.5. If you rolled a double, roll the dice again and take another move (steps 1-4).
 Watch out! If you roll doubles 3 times on the same turn, you must  Go to Jail.
6. When you finish your move and action, pass the dice to the player on your left.HELP!
I’M IN DEBT!
If you ever owe the Bank or another player more 
cash than you have, try to raise the money by selling 
Clubhouses and Playgrounds and/or mortgaging 
properties. 
If you still owe more than you have, you are 
BANKRUPT and out of the game!
◆ Pay whatever money you were able to raise.
◆ If the debt is to another player – give them all your 
mortgaged properties and any Get Out of Jail Free  
cards. The player must pay 10% interest on each mortgaged property, even if they don’t want to pay off the mortgage yet.
◆ If your debt is to the Bank – all your mortgaged 
properties must be put up for auction. These are sold unmortgaged (face up). r eturn any 
Get Out of Jail 
Free cards to the bottom of the appropriate piles.WHERE DID 
YOU LAND?1: AN UNOWNED PROPERTY
There are three types of properties:
 
 
You can buy the property you land on for the listed price on the board space. Pay the Bank, then take the Title Deed card that matches the property and place it near you, face up.If you don’t want to pay the  listed price, the property goes  up for auction.
When buying property you 
should plan to acquire groups.  
For example: 
if you buy a green location, you 
should try to get the other two 
green locations during the game. 
Owning groups earns you more 
rent when other players land on 
them and lets you build on your 
location for even bigger profits.2: A PROPERTY OWNED BY ANOTHER PLAYER
If you land on another player’s property you must pay rent to 
them as shown on the Title Deed card. You do not pay rent if the property is mortgaged (its Title Deed is face down). Important: the owner must ask you for the rent before the player to your left rolls the dice. If they forget to ask, you don’t have to pay!
loCATIo NS
The rent for an unimproved location is printed on the  
matching Title Deed card. This is doubled if the owner owns all locations in its color group and none of them are mortgaged.  
If the location is improved with Clubhouses or Playgrounds, the rent will be much higher – as shown on the Title Deed card.TrANSporTS
rent depends on how many Transports the other player owns.

until you need to use it or sell it to  
another player.

Important: You do not collect $200 
for passing GO if you are sent to Jail. As soon as you are sent to Jail, your  turn ends – pass the dice!
Other ways to end up in Jail…◆ Draw a SNACkY S’MOreS or 
CheeSY POOFS card that tells you to 
Go to Jail .
◆ roll three doubles in a row on  
your turn.Q: How do I get out of Jail? 
A:  You’ve got 3 options…
i Pay $50 at the start of your next turn, then roll and move as normal.
ii Use a 
Get Out of Jail Free  card if you have one or buy 
one from another player. Put the card to the bottom of the appropriate pile, then roll and move.
iii Wait three turns. On each turn roll the dice; if you get  a double, move out of Jail and around the board using this roll. If you do not get a double on your third roll, you must pay $50 to the Bank, then move the number of spaces rolled.6: JAIL (JUST VISITING)

◆ A player lands on an unowned 
property and decides not to  buy it for the listed price.
◆ A player goes bankrupt and turns over all his or her mortgaged properties to the Bank, which are auctioned unmortgaged (face up).
◆ There is a Clubhouse/Playground shortage and more than one player wants to buy the same Clubhouse(s)/Playground(s). Auction bids can only be made in cash. Any player can start the bidding for as little as $1. If no one makes a higher bid, the last player to bid must buy the property.
3: BUILD
When you own all the locations in a color group, you can buy 
Clubhouses/Playgrounds from the Bank and put them on any of those locations.
i The listed price of each Clubhouse is shown on 
the location’s Title Deed.
ii You must build evenly. You cannot build a second Clubhouse on a location until you have built one on each location of its color group.
iii You can have a maximum of 4 Clubhouses on a single location.
iv When you have 4 Clubhouses on a location, you can 
exchange them for a Playground by paying the listed price on the Title Deed. You can only have one Playground per location and cannot build additional Clubhouses on a location with a Playground.Important: you cannot build on a location if any location in its color 
group is mortgaged.
Clubhouse/Playground shortage? If there are no Clubhouses/
Playgrounds left in the Bank, you must wait for other players to sell theirs before you can buy any. If Clubhouses/Playgrounds are limited and two or more players wish to buy them, the Banker must auction them off to the highest bidder.
4: SELL CLUBHOUSES/PLAYGROUNDS   
Buildings can be sold back to the Bank at half the listed price. 
Buildings must be sold evenly in the same way that they were bought. Playgrounds are sold for half the listed price and immediately exchanged for 4 Clubhouses.
5: MORTGAGE PROPERTIES
If you’re low on cash or don’t have enough to pay  
a debt, you can mortgage any of your unimproved 
properties. You must sell all Clubhouses/Playgrounds on a color group to the Bank before you can mortgage one of its locations.To mortgage a property turn its Title Deed card face down 
and collect the listed value (shown on the back of the card) 
from the Bank. To repay a mortgage, pay the listed value 
plus 10% to the Bank then turn the card face up. rent cannot 
be collected on mortgaged properties.
6: DO A DEAL
You can do a deal with another player to buy or sell unimproved property. You must sell all buildings on a color group to the Bank before you can sell one of its locations.
Property can be traded for any combination of cash, other 
property or 
Get Out of Jail Free  cards. The amount is 
decided by the players making the deal.
Mortgaged property can be sold to  
another player at any agreed price.  
After buying a mortgaged property, you  
must either repay it immediately or just  pay 10% of the listed value and keep the card face down; if you later decide to repay to the bank the mortgage, you 
will have to pay the 10% fee again.
 
Remember: your aim is not just to get rich. To win you must make every other player BANKRUPT!

group is mortgaged.

properties. You must sell all Clubhouses/Playgrounds on a color group to the Bank before you can mortgage one of its locations.To mortgage a property turn its Title Deed card face down 
and collect the listed value (shown on the back of the card) 
from the Bank. To repay a mortgage, pay the listed value 
plus 10% to the Bank then turn the card face up. rent cannot 
be collected on mortgaged properties.

property or 
Get Out of Jail Free  cards. The amount is 
decided by the players making the deal.
Mortgaged property can be sold to  
another player at any agreed price.  
After buying a mortgaged property, you  
must either repay it immediately or just  pay 10% of the listed value and keep the card face down; if you later decide to repay to the bank the mortgage, you 
will have to pay the 10% fee again.
 
Remember: your aim is not just to get rich. To win you must make every other player BANKRUPT!

HERE’S HOW TO PLAYHERE’S HOW TO PLAY
HOW DO I WIN?
Be the only player left in the game after 
everyone else has gone bankrupt.
Do this by: buying properties and 
charging other players rent for landing on them.
Collect groups of properties to 
increase the rent, then build Clubhouses and Playgrounds to really boost your income.
WHO GOES FIRST?
each player rolls the two dice.  
The highest roller takes the first turn.ON YOUR TURN
1. r oll the two dice.
2. Move your token clockwise around the board the number of spaces shown on the dice.
3. You will need to take action depending on which space you land on.
 See 
Where Did You 
Land?  below.
4. If your move  took you onto or past the GO space, collect $200 from the Bank.5. If you rolled a double, roll the dice again and take another move (steps 1-4).
 Watch out! If you roll doubles 3 times on the same turn, you must  Go to Jail.
6. When you finish your move and action, pass the dice to the player on your left.HELP!
I’M IN DEBT!
If you ever owe the Bank or another player more 
cash than you have, try to raise the money by selling 
Clubhouses and Playgrounds and/or mortgaging 
properties. 
If you still owe more than you have, you are 
BANKRUPT and out of the game!
◆ Pay whatever money you were able to raise.
◆ If the debt is to another player – give them all your 
mortgaged properties and any Get Out of Jail Free  
cards. The player must pay 10% interest on each mortgaged property, even if they don’t want to pay off the mortgage yet.
◆ If your debt is to the Bank – all your mortgaged 
properties must be put up for auction. These are sold unmortgaged (face up). r eturn any 
Get Out of Jail 
Free cards to the bottom of the appropriate piles.WHERE DID 
YOU LAND?1: AN UNOWNED PROPERTY
There are three types of properties:
 
 
You can buy the property you land on for the listed price on the board space. Pay the Bank, then take the Title Deed card that matches the property and place it near you, face up.If you don’t want to pay the  listed price, the property goes  up for auction.
When buying property you 
should plan to acquire groups.  
For example: 
if you buy a green location, you 
should try to get the other two 
green locations during the game. 
Owning groups earns you more 
rent when other players land on 
them and lets you build on your 
location for even bigger profits.2: A PROPERTY OWNED BY ANOTHER PLAYER
If you land on another player’s property you must pay rent to 
them as shown on the Title Deed card. You do not pay rent if the property is mortgaged (its Title Deed is face down). Important: the owner must ask you for the rent before the player to your left rolls the dice. If they forget to ask, you don’t have to pay!
loCATIo NS
The rent for an unimproved location is printed on the  
matching Title Deed card. This is doubled if the owner owns all locations in its color group and none of them are mortgaged.  
If the location is improved with Clubhouses or Playgrounds, the rent will be much higher – as shown on the Title Deed card.TrANSporTS
rent depends on how many Transports the other player owns.

rent: $25 $50 $100 $200
MEpHESTo’S  GENETIC  ENGINEEr ING rANCH

roll the dice and multiply the result by  
4 – this is the rent you must pay.
If the owning player owns both 
Mephesto’s Genetic engineering ranch
& Tynacorp, multiply the result by 10!3:  SNACKY S’MORES or  
CHEESY POOFS
Take the top card from the appropriate pile, 
follow the instructions on it immediately, then return it face down to the bottom of the pile.If it is a 
Get Out of Jail Free  card, keep it  
until you need to use it or sell it to  
another player.
4:  AAAAAND, IT’S GONE!/  
GOOBACK TAX
If you land on one of these spaces, you must pay 
the Bank the amount shown.5: GO TO JAIL
If you land on this space, you must move your token to the Jail space immediately.
Important: You do not collect $200 
for passing GO if you are sent to Jail. As soon as you are sent to Jail, your  turn ends – pass the dice!
Other ways to end up in Jail…◆ Draw a SNACkY S’MOreS or 
CheeSY POOFS card that tells you to 
Go to Jail .
◆ roll three doubles in a row on  
your turn.Q: How do I get out of Jail? 
A:  You’ve got 3 options…
i Pay $50 at the start of your next turn, then roll and 
move as normal.
ii Use a Get Out of Jail Free  card if you have one or buy 
one from another player. Put the card to the bottom of the appropriate pile, then roll and move.
iii Wait three turns. On each turn roll the dice; if you get  a double, move out of Jail and around the board using this roll. If you do not get a double on your third roll, you must pay $50 to the Bank, then move the number of spaces rolled.6: JAIL (JUST VISITING)
Don’t worry! If you finish your normal move on the Jail space, nothing happens. Make sure you put your token on the JUST VISITING section.
7: FREE 
PARKING
relax! Nothing bad  
(or good) happens. 
8: A PROPERTY THAT YOU OWN
Nothing happens. But you’re not making any money!DON’T WAIT FOR THE DICE!DON’T WAIT FOR THE DICE!
You can do the following even when it isn’t your turn – even if 
you’re in Jail!

◆ A player lands on an unowned 
property and decides not to  buy it for the listed price.
◆ A player goes bankrupt and turns over all his or her mortgaged properties to the Bank, which are auctioned unmortgaged (face up).
◆ There is a Clubhouse/Playground shortage and more than one player wants to buy the same Clubhouse(s)/Playground(s). Auction bids can only be made in cash. Any player can start the bidding for as little as $1. If no one makes a higher bid, the last player to bid must buy the property.

Clubhouses/Playgrounds from the Bank and put them on any of those locations.

RULES for a SHORT GAME (60-90 minutes)  
There are four changed rules for this first Short Game.
1.  During PREPARATION, the Banker shuffles then deals 
three Title Deed cards to each player. These are Free.  
No payment to the Bank is required.  
2.  You need only three Clubhouses (instead of four) on each property of a complete color group before you may buy a Playground. Playground rent remains the same. The turn-in value is still one-half of  the purchase value, which in this game is one Clubhouse less than in the regular game.  
3.  If you land in Jail you must exit on your next turn by 
(1) using a “Get Out of Jail Free” card if you have (or can buy) one;  (2) rolling doubles; or (3) paying $50. Unlike the standard rules, you may try to roll doubles and, failing to do so, pay the $50 on the same turn.SPEED PLAY RULES

rules. This is fine, but such rules often make the game last longer. In the official rules players may never loan each other money or trade ‘promises’ not to charge rent in the future, etc. All tax and penalty fees are payable to the Bank and should not be stored under the Free Parking space or anywhere else!DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY FAST?DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY FAST?
END OF GAME:  The game ends when one player goes 
bankrupt. The remaining players add up their: (1) Dollars on
