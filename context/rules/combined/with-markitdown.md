Monopoly/Official Rules

This section of the Monopoly wikibook will detail the official rules of the game. The object of the game
is to drive all of your opponents into bankruptcy.

Setup

To prepare the game:

The board is laid out on the playing surface.
The Chance and Community Chest card decks are
shuffled and laid face down on their designated
positions on the board.
One player is selected to be the Banker. The Banker
will manage the Bank's assets – dealing out title
deeds, bonus money and buildings to players,
collecting taxes and penalty money, and conducting
auctions. The Banker may participate in the game if
they want to, but they must keep their personal
assets separate from the Bank's assets at all times.
Each player selects a token and places it on GO.

The game starts at Go.

Each player is dealt  1,500: two  500 notes, four  100 notes, one  50 note, one  20 note,
two  10 notes, one  5 note and 5  1 notes. The exact distribution may differ between
editions.
Each player rolls the dice. The player with the highest total takes the first turn. In the event
of a tie, roll again.

Basic Gameplay

A player's turn consists of that player rolling the dice and moving their token clockwise that many spaces
around the board. Then, the player undertakes an action corresponding to the type of space they landed
on. Then, their turn ends and play passes to the next player clockwise from them.

If a player rolls doubles (the same value on both dice), then after they have resolved the action for the
space  they  landed  on  they  are  allowed  to  roll  the  dice  again  and  take  an  additional  turn.  If  they  roll
doubles  a  second  consecutive  time,  they  are  allowed  to  take  a  second  additional  turn.  However,  if  the
player rolls doubles a third consecutive time they are "caught speeding" – they must go directly to Jail,
and their turn is over.

₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩Types of Spaces

There are two broad types of spaces in Monopoly – properties and action spaces.

Properties

There are 28 properties in the game, each of which has a title deed card associated with it, detailing rent,
building cost and mortgage value. The properties are divided as follows:

Streets are the most numerous property – there are 22 streets in the game. Each street
belongs to a colour set alongside one or two other streets. Starting from GO and
proceeding clockwise, the colour sets are brown (purple in earlier editions), light blue, pink,
orange, red, yellow, green and dark blue. Each street space has a coloured bar along the
top indicating what colour set that street belongs to – this bar is also present on the title
deed.
There are four railroads (also known as stations) located at the centre of each side of the
board.
Finally, there are two utilities, the Electric Company and the Water Works. The Electric
Company is in between St. Charles Place/Pall Mall and States Avenue/Whitehall, while the
Water Works is in between Ventnor Avenue/Coventry Street and Marvin Gardens/Piccadilly.

Action Spaces

There are 12 action spaces, organised as follows:

Six card spaces, which are divided into three Chance spaces and three Community
Chest spaces.
Two tax spaces, Income and Luxury.
The four corner spaces, which are GO, Jail, Free Parking and Go to Jail.

Landing on Spaces

When a player lands on a space, they take an action determined by the type of space they landed on:

If the player lands on an unowned property, they may choose to either buy the property or
put it up for auction.

If the player chooses to buy the property, they pay the property's price, which is listed at
the bottom of its space, to the Bank. Then the Banker gives them the property's title
deed, which the new owner displays face up in front of them to designate that they own
the property.
If the player chooses not to buy the property, the property is put up for auction by the
Banker, where each player (including the player who deferred buying the property)
attempts to out-bid their opponents. Bidding starts at  10 and may be increased by
increments of as little as  1. Also, bidding does not have to follow turn order. Each
player must make a bid that is  1 higher than the previous bid. Once bidding has
reached a high enough amount that no-one wants to bid any further, the player who
made the highest bid wins the property for the agreed price. They pay the agreed price

₩₩₩to the Bank and receive the title deed. Also, if no-one wants to bid on the property, the
property remains unsold and the title deed remains with the Bank.

If the player lands on a property that is owned by another player, the owner must ask
them for rent.

If the owner asks for rent, the lander must pay the owner rent. The amount of money
paid will be stated by the title deed:

For streets, rent is influenced by the street's monopoly status, development level and
mortgage status.
For railroads/stations, rent is determined by how many railroads/stations the owner
owns – one railroad/station gives a rent of  25, two railroads/stations  50, three
100 and all four  200.
For utilities, the total of the dice is multiplied by a number to give the rent amount. If
the owner owns one utility the dice total is multiplied by four, and if the owner owns
both utilities the dice total is multiplied by ten.

If the owner fails to ask for rent before the next player in turn order rolls the dice, the
lander does not have to pay.

If the player lands on a Chance or Community Chest space, they must draw the top card
from the appropriate deck. Then they follow the card's instructions, which will either involve
paying or losing money or moving to a specific space. Once the instructions have been
carried out, the card is returned to the bottom of the appropriate deck.

The exceptions are the Get Out of Jail Free cards, of which there is one in each deck. If
the player draws a Get Out of Jail Free card, they must keep it face up in front of them
until they are ready to use or trade it.

If the player lands on a tax space, they must pay the appropriate amount to the Bank.

In earlier versions of the game, a player who landed on Income Tax was given one of
two choices – they could pay  200 as with later editions, or they could calculate 10% of
their total net worth in buildings, cash and properties and pay that. Once locked in the
choice was final – no leeway was given to reverse an unwise choice. The 10% option
was eliminated in the September 2008 graphic redesign of the game.

If the player lands on Free Parking, Jail or a property that they own, nothing happens.
The player will move from these spaces on their next turn.

If the player lands on Jail as part of a normal turn, they place their token in the "Just
Visiting" section of the space. They are unhindered and may move from Jail on their next
turn.

If the player lands on or passes GO, they receive a  200 salary from the Bank.
Finally, if the player lands on Go to Jail, they must move their token to the "In Jail" section
of the Jail space immediately. They move directly into Jail, so they do not pass GO and do
not collect a salary, and their turn is over.

Jail

A player will be sent to Jail if:

They land on the Go to Jail space.
They draw a Chance or Community Chest card that instructs them to "Go to Jail".
They roll doubles three consecutive times on the dice.

₩₩₩₩₩₩As already stated in the property actions heading above, If the
player lands on Jail as part of a normal turn, they place their
token  in  the  "Just  Visiting"  section  of  the  space.  They  are
unhindered and may move from Jail on their next turn.

Whilst  a  player  is  in  Jail,  they  will  be  unable  to  move.
However,  they  may  still  take  part  in  other  actions,  such  as
buying  and  selling  buildings,  taking  part  in  auctions,
collecting rent and trading.

In order to get out of Jail, a player has three options:

A piece in Jail. Passing pieces stay off
the "In Jail" section in orange.

Pay a  50 fine, then roll and move as normal.
Use a Get Out of Jail Free card. The card is
returned to the bottom of the appropriate deck, then the player rolls and moves as normal.
The player may roll the dice. If they roll a double, they are released from Jail. They will use
the roll to move, but unlike a normal double they will not be allowed to roll again. If the
player does not roll a double, they remain in Jail.

If the player fails to roll a double by their third turn in Jail, then if the third roll is not a double the player
will be forced to pay  50. Then they use the roll to move.

Buying Buildings

If  a  player  owns  all  of  the  streets  in  a  colour  set,  they  have  a  monopoly  on  that  colour  set.  Rent  on
unimproved properties in that colour set will be doubled, and that player may start buying buildings on
streets  in  that  colour  set  to  increase  the  rent,  provided  none  of  the  properties  in  that  colour  set  are
mortgaged (which will be explained later).

Buildings may only be built on streets – not on railroads/stations or utilities.

There are two types of buildings in Monopoly: houses and hotels. Houses, which are coloured green, are
always built first, followed by hotels, which are coloured red. A player may build buildings at any time
they like – they do not have to wait for their turn. The prices of houses and hotels are listed on the street's
title deed -  50 for the browns and light blues,  100 for the pinks and oranges,  150 for the reds and
yellows and  200 for the greens and dark blues.

If a player wants to build a house on a street, they pay the amount listed on the street's title deed and take
a house from the Bank, which they place on the colour strip running along the top of the street's board
space.

Players must build evenly – if one street in the colour set has a house, a second house may not be built
until  houses  have  been  built  on  the  other  streets.  Likewise,  a  street  with  two  houses  may  not  receive  a
third until all of the streets in the colour set have two houses, and so on.

The maximum number of houses that may be placed on a street is four. After that, if all of the streets in
that colour set have four houses, the player may pay to upgrade the houses to a hotel. The player pays the
appropriate  amount,  then  returns  the  four  houses  to  the  Bank  and  places  a  hotel  on  the  street's  colour
strip. Once a street has a hotel it may not be improved further.

₩₩₩₩₩₩There are 32 houses and 12 hotels available from the Bank. If there are no houses left in the Bank, no
player will be able to purchase new houses until houses are freed up, either from being upgraded to hotels
or being sold. However, if a player has sufficient funds they may elect to upgrade a property directly to a
hotel if they so wish. If no hotels are left in the Bank, then four-house groups may not be upgraded until
new hotels become available.

The fact that players may buy buildings at any time may result in a situation where multiple players want
to  buy  the  last  of  a  particular  building.  If  this  happens,  the  building(s)  in  question  will  be  put  up  for
auction, the auction working the same way as with a property auction.

Trading

A trade consists of a deal in which two players exchange some of their assets.

A player may propose a trade with another player at any point in the game, even when it is not their turn.
There are three assets that may be involved in a trade – money, properties and Get Out of Jail Free cards.
The amount traded is decided by the players making the deal.

If a player wishes to trade a street, any buildings on that street's colour set must be sold beforehand.

The  player  who  has  been  offered  the  trade  may  accept,  reject,  or  propose  a  counter-offer  on  their  own
terms.

Trades may not be used to loan or gift players money.

Help! I Can't Pay!

If a player finds that they owe money but do not have enough physical money to pay the debt, they will
need to raise money to pay the debt. This can be done by selling buildings and mortgaging properties.

Selling Buildings

If a player wants to sell a building, they return the building to the Bank and collect the sale price, which is
half of the initial purchase price for buildings in that colour set. Selling a hotel will immediately replace it
with four houses. And like with buying buildings, buildings must be sold evenly across the colour set.

Mortgaging Properties

A player may mortgage a property once all of the buildings in its colour set have been sold. To mortgage,
the  property's  title  deed  is  flipped  over,  revealing  the  "mortgaged"  side,  and  the  player  collects  the
mortgage value from the Bank. Whilst a property is mortgaged rent cannot be collected on it. However,
mortgaged streets in a monopoly do not prevent the unimproved unmortgaged properties in that colour set
from charging double rent. The boosted rent from owning multiple railroads/stations or utilities may be
collected in the same manner even if some of those properties are mortgaged.

A  player  may  unmortgage  a  property  later  if  they  have  sufficient  funds. To  unmortgage  a  property,  the
player  pays  back  the  mortgage  value  +  10%  interest  and  flips  the  title  deed  back  over  to  its
"unmortgaged" side.

If  a  player  receives  a  mortgaged  property  through  a  trade  or  by  bankrupting  someone,  they  must
immediately choose between unmortgaging the property or only paying the 10% interest and leaving the
property mortgaged.

Bankruptcy and the End of the Game

If a player is in the very unfortunate situation where they have sold all of their buildings and mortgaged
all  of  their  properties,  and  still  do  not  have  enough  money  to  pay  a  debt,  that  player  is  bankrupt,  and
they are out of the game. Their token is removed from the board, and what happens next depends on who
bankrupted them:

If the player was bankrupted by another player, the debtor must immediately turn over all of
their remaining assets to the creditor - money, properties and Get Out of Jail Free cards. If
mortgaged properties are among these assets, the creditor will immediately have to decide
to unmortgage the properties or keep the mortgages (which, if they are unlucky, could result
in them going bankrupt too).
If the player was bankrupted by the Bank (e.g. via a tax they do not have the money to pay),
the Bank will seize all of the debtor's assets – Any mortgaged properties have their
mortgages cancelled, any money is returned to the Bank and any Get Out of Jail Free cards
are returned to the bottom of the appropriate decks. Then, the Bank will auction off all the
properties it has seized.

The game ends once all but one player is bankrupt – that player is the winner.

Short and Timed Games

Short Game

The official Monopoly rules allow for a "short game" to be played if the players so want. A short game
uses five alterations to the rules to speed up the progression of the game, as follows:

During preparation of the game, the Banker shuffles the title deeds and deals two deeds to
each player. These deeds are free - no payment is required.
A player will only need to buy three houses on a street before they may upgrade to a hotel.
The sale price is still half of the purchase price.

If the version of Monopoly being used offers the 10% option for Income Tax, then a flat  200
tax is imposed.
If a player is sent to Jail, they must exit on their next turn by any of the standard methods. If
they try to roll doubles and fail, they must pay  50.
The game ends once one player is bankrupted. After that player's assets are turned over to
the creditor, the remaining players count up their net worth, which consists of:

their cash on hand
all unmortgaged properties owned at the price printed on the board

₩₩all mortgaged properties owned at one-half of the price printed on the board
all houses valued at purchase price
all hotels valued at purchase price plus the value of the houses turned in

The richest player wins.

Timed Game

Another way to shorten Monopoly is to play a timed game. Before beginning play the players agree to a
set length of time to play. Once this time elapses the game ends and the richest player wins.

The only alteration made to the rules is that during preparation of the game, the Banker shuffles the title
deeds and deals two deeds to each player. The players must immediately pay the price of these properties
to the Bank.

Other Notes

The Bank cannot go bankrupt. If the Bank runs out of money, the Banker may issue as
much as needed by writing on any ordinary paper.

Monopoly Rules

HISTORY… PARKER BROTHERS Real Estate Trading Game MONOPOLY© was invented during the Great Depression by Charles
B. Darrow of Germantown Pennsylvania. Mr. Darrow, like. many other Americans, was unemployed at the time and he worked out the
details of the game primarily to amuse himself during this period. Prior to the Depression, Darrow and his wife vacationed in the resort
town of Atlantic City, New Jersey. When it came to naming the streets on the game board, Darrow naturally adopted those of his favorite
vacation spot.
The first games were handmade. Darrow gave them to friends and sold a few through a Philadelphia department store. As the demand for
the game grew, Darrow could not keep up with the orders and arranged for Parker Brothers to take over the game.
Since 1935 when Parker Brothers acquired the rights to the game, it has become the leading proprietary game not only in the United States
but throughout the Western world. the game is published under license in twenty&SHY;five countries and in fifteen foreign languages.

OBJECT...The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling property.

EQUIPMENT...The equipment consists of a board, 2 dice, tokens 32 houses and 12 hotels. There are Chance and Community Chest
cards, a Title Deed card for each property and play money.

PREPARATION...Place the board on a table and put the Chance and Community Chest cards face-down on their allotted spaces on the
board. Each player chooses one token to represent him on his travels around the board.

Each player is given $1500 divided as follows: 2 each of $500's, $100's and $50's; 6-$20's; 5 each of $10's, $5's and $1's.
All remaining money and other equipment go to the Bank.

BANKER...Select as Banker a player who will also make a good Auctioneer. If the Banker plays in the game, he must keep his personal
funds separate from those of the Bank. When more than five persons play, the Banker may elect to act only as Banker and Auctioneer.

THE BANK...Besides the Bank's money, the Bank holds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase and use by the
players. The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells and auctions properties and hands out their proper Title Deed cards; it sells houses
and hotels to the players and loans money when required on mortgages.

The Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of all properties which it sells and auctions.

The Bank never "goes broke". If the Bank runs out of money it may issue as much more as may be needed by merely writing on any
ordinary paper.

THE PLAY... Starting with the Banker, each player in turn throws the dice. The player with the highest total starts the play. He places his
token on the corner marked "GO", throws the 2 dice and moves his token in the direction of the arrow the number of spaces indicated by
the dice. After he has completed his play, the turn to play passes to the left. The tokens remain on the spaces occupied and proceed from
that point on the player's next turn. Two or more tokens may rest on the same space at the same time.

According to the space which his token reaches, a player may be entitled to buy real estate or other properties, -or be obliged to pay rent,
pay taxes, draw a Chance or Community Chest card, "Go to Jail", etc.

If a player throws doubles he moves his token as usual the sum of the two dice and is subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to
the space on which he lands. Retaining the dice, he throws again and moves his token as before. If a player throws doubles three times in
succession, he moves his token immediately to the space marked "In Jail" (see JAIL).

"GO"...Each time a player's token lands on or passes over "GO", whether by throw of the dice or by drawing a card, the Banker pays him
$200 salary.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

However, $200 is paid only once each time around the board. If a player, passing "GO" on the throw of the dice, lands 2 spaces beyond it
on "Community Chest", or 7 spaces beyond it on "Chance", and draws the card "Advance to GO", he collects $200 for passing "GO" the
first time and another $200 for reaching it the second time by instructions on the card.

BUYING PROPERTY...Whenever a player lands on an unowned property he may buy that property from the Bank at its printed price.
He receives the Title Deed card showing ownership and places it face-up in front of him.

If he does not wish to buy the property it is sold at auction by the Banker to the highest bidder. The buyer pays to the Bank the amount of
the bid in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that property. Any player, including the one who declined the option of buying it at the
printed price, may bid. Bidding may start at any price.

PAYING RENT...When a player lands on property owned by another player the owner collects rent from him in accordance with the list
printed on the Title Deed card applying to it.

If the property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. When a property is mortgaged its Title Deed card is placed face-down in front of
the owner.

It is an advantage to hold all the Title Deeds in a color-group (i.e.: Boardwalk and Park Place, - or Connecticut, Vermont and Oriental
Avenues) because the owner may then charge double rent for unimproved properties in that color-group. This rule applies to unmortgaged
properties even if another property in that color-group is mortgaged.

It is even more of an advantage to have houses or hotels on properties because rents are much higher than for unimproved properties.

The owner may not collect his rent if he fails to ask for it before the second player following throws the dice.

"CHANCE" and "COMMUNITY CHEST"...When a player lands on either of these spaces he takes the top card from the deck indicated,
follows the instructions and returns the card face-down to the bottom of the deck.

The "Get Out of Jail Free" card is held until used and then returned to the bottom of the deck. If the player who draws it does not wish to
use it he may sell it, at any time, to another player at a price agreeable to both.

"INCOME TAX"...When a player lands on "Income Tax" he has two options: he may estimate his tax at $200 and pay the Bank, or he
may pay 10% of his total worth to the Bank. His total worth is all his cash on hand, printed prices of mortgaged and unmortgaged
properties and cost price of all buildings he owns.

The player must decide which option he will take before he adds up his total worth.

JAIL...A player lands in Jail when. . . (1.) his token lands on the space marked "Go to Jail"; (2.) he draws a card marked "Go to Jail"; (3.)
he throws doubles three times in succession.

When a player is sent to Jail he cannot collect $200 salary in that move since, regardless of where his token is on the board, he must move
it directly into Jail. A player's turn ends when he is sent to Jail.

If a player is not "sent to Jail" but in the ordinary course of play lands on that space, he is "Just Visiting", incurs no penalty, and moves
ahead in the usual manner on his next turn.

A player gets out of Jail by... (1.) throwing doubles on any of his next three turns. If he succeeds in doing this he immediately moves
forward the number of spaces shown by his doubles throw. Even though he has thrown doubles he does not take another turn; (2.) using
the "Get Out of Jail Free" card if he has it; (3.) purchasing the "Get Out of Jail Free" card from another player and playing it; (4.) paying a
fine of $50 before he rolls the dice on either of his next two turns

If the player does not throw doubles by his third turn he must pay the $50 fine. He then gets out of Jail and immediately moves forward
the number of spaces shown by his throw.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Even though he is in Jail, a player may buy or sell property, buy or sell houses and hotels and collect rents.

FREE PARKING...A player landing on this space does not receive any money, property or reward of any kind. This is just a "free"
resting place.

HOUSES...When a player owns all the properties in a color & SHY; group he may buy houses from the Bank and erect them on those
properties.

If he buys one house, he may put it on any one of those properties. The next house he buys must be erected on one of the unimproved
properties of this or any other complete color-group he may own.

The price he must pay the Bank for each house is shown on his Title Deed card for the property on which he erects the house.

The owner can still collect double rent from an opponent who lands on the unimproved properties of his complete color-group.

Following the above rules, a player may buy and erect at any time as many houses as his judgment and financial standing will allow. But
he must build evenly (i.e.: he cannot erect more than one house on any one property of any color-group until he has built one house on
every property of that group. He may then begin on the second row of houses, and so on, up to a limit of four houses to a property. For
example, he cannot build three houses on one property if he has only one house on another property of that group.).

As a player builds evenly, he must also break down evenly if he sells houses back to the Bank (SEE SELLING PROPERTY).

HOTELS...When a player has four houses on each property of a complete color-group, he may buy a hotel from the Bank and erect it on
any property of that color-group. He returns the four houses from that property to the Bank and pays the price for the hotel as shown on
the Title Deed card. Only one hotel may be erected on any one property.

BUILDING SHORTAGE...When the Bank has no houses to sell, players wishing to build must wait for some player to turn back or to
sell his houses to the Bank before building. If there are a limited number of houses and hotels available, and two or more players wish to
buy more than the Bank has, the houses or hotels must be sold at auction to the highest bidder.

SELLING PROPERTY... Unimproved properties, railroads and utilities (but not buildings) may be sold to any player as a private
transaction for any amount that the owner can get. However, no property can be sold to another player if buildings are standing on any
properties of that color-group. Any buildings so located must be sold back to the Bank before the owner can sell any property of that
color-group.

Houses and hotels may be sold back to the Bank at any time for one-half the price paid for them.
All houses on one color-group must be sold one by one, evenly, in reverse of the manner in which they were erected.
All hotels on one color-group may be sold at once. Or they may be sold one house at a time (one hotel equals five houses), evenly, in
reverse of the manner in which they were erected.

MORTGAGES...Unimproved properties can be mortgaged through the Bank at any time. Before an improved property can be mortgaged
all the buildings on all the properties of its color-group must be sold back to the Bank at half price. The mortgage value is printed on each
Title Deed card.

No rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities, but rent can be collected on unmortgaged properties in the same group.
In order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the amount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When all the properties of a
color-group are no longer mortgaged the owner may begin to buy back houses at full price.

The player who mortgages property retains possession of it and no other player may secure it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank.
However, the owner may sell this mortgaged property to another player at any agreed price. The new owner may lift the mortgage at once,
if he wishes, by paying off the mortgage plus 10% interest to the Bank. If he does not lift the mortgage at once he must pay the Bank 10%

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

interest when he buys the property and if he lifts the mortgage later he must pay an additional 10% interest as well as the amount of the
mortgage to the Bank.

BANKRUPTCY...A player is bankrupt when he owes more than he can pay either to another player or to the Bank. If his debt is to
another player, he must turn over to that player all that he has of value and retire from the game. In making this settlement, if he owns
houses or hotels, he must return these to the Bank in exchange for money to the extent of one-half the amount paid for them and this cash
is given to the creditor. If he has mortgaged property he also turns this property over to his creditor but the new owner must at once pay
the Bank the amount of interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of the property. After the new owner does this, he may, at his
option, pay the principal or hold the property until some later turn at which time he may lift the mortgage. If he holds property in this way
until a later turn, he must pay the interest again when he lifts the mortgage.

Should a player owe the Bank, instead of another player, more than he can pay (because of taxes or penalties) even by selling his
buildings and mortgaging property, he must turn over all his assets to the Bank. In this case, the Bank immediately sells by auction all
property so taken, except buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the game. The last player left in the game wins.

MISCELLANEOUS...Money can only be loaned to a player by the Bank and then only by mortgaging property. No player may borrow
from or lend money to another player.

RULES for a SHORT GAME (60 to 90 minutes of fun) There are three differences in rules for this "Short Game".

1. During PREPARATION for play the Banker shuffles the pack of Title Deed cards. The pack is then cut by the player at his left and the
Banker deals, one at a time, two Title Deed cards to each player; including himself if he both plays and acts as Banker. Players receiving
Title Deed cards must immediately pay the Bank the printed price of each of the two properties thus acquired. The play then commences
as in the regular game.

2. In this short game it is only necessary to have three houses (instead of four) on each lot of a complete color-group before the player may
buy a hotel.

Rent received for a hotel remains the same as in the regular game.

The turn-in value of a hotel is still one-half the purchase price, which in this game is one house less than in the regular game.

3. END OF GAME. The first player to go bankrupt retires from the game as in the regular game. However, when the second bankruptcy
occurs the game ends. Play immediately ceases with the bankrupt player turning over to his creditor all that he has of value, including
buildings and any other properties-whether the creditor happens to be a rival player or the Bank.

Each remaining player then values his property and cash on hand (2.) lots, utilities and railroads owned by him at the price printed on the
board; (3.) any mortgaged property owned by him at one-half price printed on the board; (4.) houses, valued at purchase price; (5.) hotels,
valued at the purchase price including the value of the three houses turned in.

the classic rules for buying, renting and selling properties or use the
Speed Die to get into the action faster. If you've never played the classic
MONOPOLY game,  refer to the Classic Rules beginning on the next page.
If you already know how to play and want to use the Speed Die, just
read the section below for the additional Speed Die rules.

SPEED DIE RULES

/  fast as  playing with i't.

Learnins how to Play with the S ~ e e d  Die IS  as

1. When starting the game,  hand out an extra $1,000 to each player
(two $5005 should work). The game moves fast and you'll need
the extra cash to buy and build.

2. Do not use the Speed Die until you've landed on or passed over
GO for the first time. Once you collect that first $200 salary, you'll
use the Speed Die for the rest of the game. This means that some
players will start using the die before others.

3. Once you start using the Speed Die, roll it along with the two
white dice on your turn. Then d o  the following depending on
what you rolled.

1,  2,  or 3: Add this number to the roll of the two white
dice. You'll zoom around the board.

Bus: This lets you "get off the bus early." Look at the two white
dice. You can move the value of one die,  the other die, or the
sum of both dice. So  if you rolled a 1 and a 5,  you can move
1 space, 5 spaces, or 6 spaces: \t's your choice.
Mr. Monopoly: First,  move the sum of the two white dice
and resolve the space you land on (such as  drawing a card,
buying the property,  paying rent, etc.). Then,  one of two
things will happen depending on whether or not there is still
property in the bank.

YES,  there is property in the bank -Advance

to the NEXT

property that the bank still holds and buy it if you wish. If you
don't want to buy this property, move to the space anyway
and put the property up for auction.

NO, there are no more properties in the bank - Advance to the
NOCT property on which you will owe another player money.

A few minor details:

Only the white dice are used when determining if you rolled doubles.
Do not look at the Speed Die.

If you roll a three-of-a-kind (all of the dice show the same number),
you can move anywhere you want on the board!

If you get sent to jail during your move (either by landing on the "Go
to Jail" space or by rolling doubles three times in a row) then your turn
is over and you do not get to use the Speed Die for that turn.
Use the white dice ONLY when rolling to get out of jail.  L
Use the sum of all three dice when determining how much to pay on
a utility. Note: The Bus and Mr. Monopoly are valued at 0.

CLASSIC MONOPOW RULES
OBJECT: The object of the game IS to become the
wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling
property.
PREPARATION:  Place the board on a table and put
the Chance and Community Chest cards facedown on

their allotted spaces on the board. Each player chooses one token to
represent himther while traveling around the board.

Each player is given $1,500 divided as follows: P each of $500s,

$ 1 0 0 ~  and $ 5 0 ~ ;  6 $ 4 0 ~ ;  5 each of $105, $ 5 ~  and $Is.

All remaining money and other equipment go to the Bank. Stack the  ..

Bank's money on edge in the compartments in the plastic Banker's tray.

BANKER. Select as  Banker a player who will also
make a good Auctioneer  A  Banker who plays
~n the game must keep hislher personal funds
separate from those of the Bank. When more than
f~ve persons play, the Banker may elect to act only
as  Banker and Auctioneer.

THE BANK:  Besides the Bank's money, the Bank
holds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase
and use by the players. The  Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells
and auctions properties and hands out the~r proper Title Deed cards;
it sells houses and hotels to the players and loans money when
required on mortgages.

The Bank collects all taxes, fines,  loans and interest, and the price of

all properties which it sells and auctions.

The Bank nwer "goes broke." If the Bank runs out of money, the Banker

may issue as  much more as  needed by writing on any ordinary paper.

THE PLAY:  Starting with the Banker, each player in turn throws the dice.

The player with the highest total starts the play: Place your
token on the corner marked "GO," throw the dice and move
your token in the direction of the arrow the number of

spaces indicated by the dice. After you have completed
your play, the turn passes to the left. The tokens remain
on the spaces qccupied and proceed from that point on
the player's next turn. Two or more tokens may rest on the
same space at the same time.

According to the space your token reaches, you may be entitled to
buy real estate or other properties - or obliged to pay rent, pay taxes,
draw a Chance or Community Chest card, "Go to Jail," etc.

If you throw doubles, you move your token as  usual, the sum of the

two dice, and are subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to
the space on which you land. Retaining the dice, throw again and move
your token as  before. If you throw doubles three times in succession,
move your token immediately to the space marked "In Jail" (see JAIL).

"GO": Each time a player's token lands on or passes over
GO, whether by throwing the dice or drawing a card,
the Banker pays himther a $200 sala,ry.

The $200 is paid only once each time kound

the board. However, if a player passing GO on
the throw of the dice lands 2 spaces beyond it
on Community Chest,  or 7 spaces beyond
it on Chance, and draws the "Advance to GO" card, helshe  collects
$200 for passing GO the first time and another $200 for reaching it the
second time by instructions on the card.

BUYING PROPERTY: Whenever you land on an unowned property you
may buy that property from the Bank at  its printed price. You  receive the
Title Deed card showing ownership;  place it faceup in front of you.

If you d o  not wish to buy the property, the Banker sells it at auction
to the highest bidder. The buyer pays the Bank the amount of the bid
in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that property. Any player,
including the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed
price, may bid. Bidding may start at any price.

When you land on property owned by another player,

PAMNG
the owner collects rent from you in accordance with the list printed on
its Title Deed card.

If the property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. When a
property is mortgaged, its Title Deed card is placed facedown in front
of the owner.

L

It is an advantage to hold all the Title Deed cards in a color-

group (e.g., Boardwalk and Park Place;  or Connecticut, Vermont and
Oriental Avenues) because the owner may then charge double rent
for unimproved properties in that color-group. This rule applies to
unmortgaged properties even if another property in that color-group is
mortgaged.

It is even more advantageous to have houses or hotels on properties

because rents are much higher than for unimproved properties.

The owner may not collect the rent if he/she fails to ask  for it before

the second player following throws the dice.
"CHANCE" AND "COMMUNITY CHEST": When you land on either of
these spaces, take the top card from the deck indicated, follow the

instructions and return the card facedown to the bottom of the deck.

The "Get Out of Jail Free" card is held until used and then returned to
the bottom of the deck. If the player who draws it does not wish to use
it, helshe may sell it, at any time, to another player at a price agreeable
to both.

"INCOME TAX":  If you land here you have two options: You  may
estimate your tax at $900 and pay the Bank,  or you may pay 10% of
your total worth to the Bank. Your  total worth is all your cash on hand,
printed prices of mortgaged and unmortgaged properties and cost
price of all buildings you own.

You must decide which option you will take before you add up

your total worth.
"JAIL":  You  land in Jail when. ..(I) your token lands on the space
marked "Go to Jail"; (2) you draw a card marked "Go to JailN; or
(3) you throw doubles three times in succession.

When you are sent to Jail you cannot

collect your $200 salary in that move
since,  regardless of where your token
is on the board, you must move it
directly into Jail. Your turn ends when
you are sent to Jail.

If you are not "sent" to Jail but in the ordinary course of play land on
that space, you are "Just Visiting," you incur no penalty, and you move
ahead in the usual manner on your next turn.

You get out of Jail by.. .(I) throwing doubles on any of your next
three turns;  if you succeed in doing this you immediately move forward
the number of spaces shown by your doubles throw; even though you
had thrown doubles, you do not take another turn;  (2) using the "Get
Out of Jail Free" card if you have it;  (3)  purchasing the "Get Out of Jail
Free" card from another player and playing it;  (4)  paying a fine of $50
before you roll the dice on either of your next two turns.

If you do not throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the $50
fine. You then get out of Jail and immediately move forward the number
of spaces shown by your throw.

Even though you are in Jail,  you may buy and sell property, buy and

sell houses and hotels and collect rents.

"FREE PARKING": A player landing on this place does not
receive any money,  property or reward of any kind. This  is just a "free"
resting place.
HOUSES:  When you own all the propert~es in a color-group
you may buy houses from the Bank and erect them on those properties.

If you buy one house, you may put it on any

one of those properties. The  next house you
buy must be erected on one of the unimproved
properties of this or any other complete color-
group you may own.

The  price you must pay the Bank for each
house is shown on your l t l e  Deed card for the
property on which you erect the house.

The  owner still collects double rent from an opponent who lands on

the unimproved properties of hisher complete color-group.

Following the above rules, you may buy and erect at any time as
many houses as  your judgement and financial standing will allow. But
you must build evenly, i.e., you cannot erect more than one house on
any one property of any color-group until you have built one house on
wery property of that group. You  may then begin on the second row
of houses, and so on,  up to a limit of four houses to a property. For
example, you cannot build three houses on one property if you have
only one house on another property of that group.

As you build evenly, you must also break down evenly ifyou sell

houses back to the Bank (see SELLING PROPERTY).

HOTELS:  When a player has four houses on each property of a
complete color-group, hdshe may buy a hotel from the Bank and erect
it on any property of the color-group. Hdshe returns the four houses
from that property to the Bank and pays the price for the hotel as  shown
on the Ttle Deed card. Only one hotel may be erected on any one
property.
BUILDING SHORTAGES: When the Bank has no houses to sell,  players
wishing to build must wait for some player to return or sell histher
houses to the Bank before building. If there are a limited number of
houses and hotels available and two or more players wish to buy more
than the Bank has,  the houses or hotels must be sold at auction to the
highest bidder.

SELLING PROPERN:  Unimproved properties, railroads and util~ties
(but not buildings) may be sold to any player as a private transaction
for any amount the owner can get;  however, no property can be sold to
another player if buildings are standing on any properties of that color-
group. Any buildings so located must be sold back to the Bank before
the owner can sell any property of that color-group.

-

Houses and hotels may be sold back to the Bank at any time for one-

half the price paid for them.

All houses on one color-group must be sold one by one, evenly,  in

reverse of the manner in which they were erected.

All hotels on one color-group may be sold at once, or they may be

sold one house at a time (one hotel equals five houses), evenly,  in
reverse of the manner in which they were erected.

MORTGAGES:  Unimproved properties can be mortgaged through the
Bank at any time. Before an improved property can be mortgaged,  all
the buildings on all the properties of its color-group must be sold back
to the Bank at half price. The  mortgage value is printed on each Title
Deed card.

No rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities,

but rent can be collected on unmortgaged properties in the
same group.

In order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the
amount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When all the propert~es of
a color-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy
back houses at full price.

The player who mortgages property retains possession of it and
no other player may secure it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank.
However, the owner may sell this mortgaged property to another player
at any agreed price. If you are the new owner, you may lift the mortgage
at once if you wish by paying off the mortgage plus
10% interest to the Bank. If the mortgage is not lifted
at once, you must pay the Bank 10% interest when
you buy the property and if you lift the
mortgage later you must pay the Bank
an additional 10% interest as well

as the amount of the mortgage.  n

,

BANKRUPTCY.. You are declared bankrupt if you owe more than you
can pay either to another player or to the Bank. If your
debt is to another player, you must tum over to that
player all that you have of value and retire from the
game. In making this settlement,  if you own houses or

hotels, you must retum these to the Bank in exchange
for money to the extent of one-half the amount paid
for them;  this cash is given to the creditor. If you have
mortgaged property you also turn this property over
to your creditor but the new owner must at once pay  .
the Bank the amount of interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of
the property. The new owner who does this may then, at hislher option,
pay the principal or hold the property until some later turn,  then lift the
mortgage. If helshe holds property in this way until a later turn,  helshe
must pay the interest again upon lifting the mortgage.

Should you owe the Bank,  instead of another player, more than you
can pay (because of taxes or penalties) even by selling off buildings
and mortgaging property, you must turn over all assets to the Bank. In
this case, the Bank immediately sells by auction all property so taken,
except buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the
game. The  last player left in the game wins.

MISCEUANEOUS: Money can be loaned to a player only by the Bank
and then only by mortgaging property. No player may borrow from or
lend money to another player.

THE PROPERTY TRADING BOARD GAME
RULES

THE GAME IN BRIEF
MONOPOLY  is  the  game  of  buying,  renting  or  selling  Properties  so
profitably  that  players  increase  their  wealth  –  the  wealthiest
becoming the eventual winner.
Starting  from  the  "GO"  space,  move  your  token  around  the  board
according to your roll of the dice. When you land on a Property that
is not already owned by anyone else, you may buy it from the Bank. If
you do not choose to buy it, it is auctioned off to the highest bidder.
Players  who  own  Properties  collect  rents  from  opponents  stopping
there.  The  construction  of  Houses  and  Hotels  greatly  increases  the
rent  you  can  collect,  so  it  is  wise  to  build  on  as  many  Sites  as
possible.  If  you  need  to  raise  more  money,  the  Bank  can  give
mortgages on Properties. You must always obey the instructions given
on Community Chest and Chance cards. Sometimes you will be sent
to Jail.

OBJECT
To be the only player left in the game who is not bankrupt.

EQUIPMENT
1 gameboard
10 playing tokens (including 2 spares)
28 Title Deed cards
16 Chance cards
16 Community Chest cards
1 pack of MONOPOLY money
32 Houses
12 Hotels
2 dice

SET UP
1. Arrange the Houses, Hotels, Title Deeds and money (in value order)
in the separate sections of the game tray.

2. Separate the Chance and Community Chest cards, shuffle them and
put them face down in the relevant spaces on the gameboard.

3. Each player selects a playing token and places it on "GO".

1

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 2

4. The Banker and the Bank
One player is elected Banker.  If there are more than five players, the
Banker may choose to take on this role only.

The Banker gives each player £1,500 divided as follows:

Two x £500
Four x £100
One x £50
One x £20

Two x £10
One x £5
Five x £1

In addition to holding the money, the Banker also keeps the Title Deed
cards, Houses and Hotels until they are bought by the players.  The
Banker also pays salaries and bonuses, lends money when required
on mortgages and collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest.  In the
event of auctions, the Banker acts as auctioneer.
The  Bank  never  "goes  bankrupt"  but  can  issue  as  much  money  as  is
necessary in the form of IOUs written on ordinary paper.

5. Players roll both dice.  The player with the highest score goes first
and play passes to the left.

PLAYING THE GAME
On your turn, roll both dice and move clockwise around the board in
the  direction  of  the  arrow.    The  space  you  land  on  will  determine
what you have to do.  Two or more tokens may rest on the same space
at the same time.  You may do one of the following according to the
space you land on:

buy Building Sites or other Properties
pay rent by landing on an owned Property
pay taxes
draw a Chance or Community Chest card
go to Jail
rest on the Free Parking space
collect £200 salary
be “Just Visiting” Jail

Doubles
If you roll a double, move your token and act on the space you have
landed on as usual.  Roll the dice again and have another turn.  If you
roll a double for a third time in succession, you must immediately go
straight to Jail.

Passing "GO"
Every  time  you  either  land  on  or  pass  "GO"  while  moving  in  the
direction of the arrow, you are paid £200 by the Bank.  It is possible
to collect £200 twice within one turn if, for example, you land on the
Chance or Community Chest space immediately after "GO" and pick
the card that tells you to "Advance to GO".

2

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 3

Buying Property
If you land on an unowned Property (that is, on a Property for which
no other player holds the Title Deed), you have the first choice to buy
it.  There are three types of Property - Sites, Utilities and Stations. If you
decide to buy, pay the Bank the price in money stated on that space.
You will receive in exchange, as proof of ownership, that Property's
Title  Deed,  which  you  must  keep  face  up  in  front  of  you.    If  you
decide not to buy, the Banker must immediately auction the Property
for sale to the highest bidder, starting at any price that another player
is willing to pay.  Even though you declined the option of buying at
the original price, you may join in the bidding, too.

Owning Property
Owning Property entitles you to collect rent from any "tenants" who
land on that space.  It is an advantage to own all the Sites within a
colour-group — in other words to own a monopoly.  You can build
on any Site for which you own the complete colour-group.

Landing on Sites
If  you  land  on  a  Site  that  has  previously  been  bought  by  another
player,  you  may  be  required  to  pay  rent  for  stopping  there.    The
player  who  owns  this  Site  must  ask  you  for  rent  before  the  player
following  you  rolls  the  dice.    The  amount  payable  is  shown  on  the
Title  Deed  for  that  Site  and  will  vary  according  to  the  number  of
buildings  on  it.    If  all  Sites  within  a  colour-group  are  owned  by  a
player, the rent payable is doubled on any Site of that group not yet
built on.  However, an owner who owns a whole colour-group may
not  collect  double  rent  if  any  one  Site  there  is  mortgaged.    Where
Houses or Hotels have been built on a Site, the rent will increase and
will  be  shown  on  that  Site's  Title  Deed.    Rent  is  not  payable  on
mortgaged Properties.

Landing on Utilities
Landing on one of these allows you to buy the Utility if it is not already
owned.    As  with  the  other  Property  spaces,  pay  the  Bank  the  price
stated  on  that  space.    If  the  Utility  is  already  owned,  you  may  be
asked to pay rent to the owner according to the dice you rolled to get
there.  If the owner has only one of the Utilities, the rent will be four
times your dice roll.  If, however, both Utilities are owned by the same
player, you must pay ten times the amount of your dice roll.
If you decide not to buy, the Banker auctions the Utility for sale to the
highest bidder.  You may join in the bidding, too.

Landing on Stations
If you are the first to land here, you have the opportunity to buy the
Station.    Otherwise  it  is  auctioned  by  the  Bank;  even  though  you
declined to buy at the original price, you may join the bidding, too.
If  the  Station  is  already  owned  when  you  arrive,  you  must  pay  the

3

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 4

amount  stated  on  the  Title  Deed.    The  amount  payable  will  vary
according to the number of other Stations owned by that player.

Landing on "Chance" and "Community Chest"
Landing on one of these spaces means you must take the relevant card
from the top of the deck.  These cards may ask you to:

move your token
pay money – for example, in taxes
receive money
go to Jail
get out  of Jail free.

You  must  follow  the  instructions  on  the  card  and  act  immediately
before returning the card to the bottom of the deck.  If you pick a "Get
Out of Jail Free" card, you may keep it until you wish to use it or sell
it at a mutually agreed price.
Note: a card may instruct you to move your token to another space.
If  you pass "GO" on the way, collect £200.  You do not  pass "GO"
when you are sent to Jail, or if you are sent back (for example, to Old
Kent Road).

Landing on Tax spaces
When you land on these, simply pay the relevant amount to the Bank.

Free parking
If  you  land  on  this  space,  you  simply  rest  here  until  your  next  turn.
There  is  no  penalty  for  landing  here:  you  may  still  undertake
transactions  as  usual  (for  example,  collect  rent,  build  on  Sites  you
own, etc.).

Jail
You will be sent to Jail if:

you land on the "GO TO JAIL" space, or
you pick a Chance or Community Chest card which tells you
to "GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL", or
you roll a double three times in succession on your turn.

Your turn ends when you are sent to Jail.  If you are sent there, you may
not collect a £200 salary, regardless of where you are on the board.

To get out of Jail you may:

pay a fine of £50 and continue on your next turn, or
purchase a "Get Out Of Jail Free" card from another player
at a mutually agreed price and use this to get out, or
use a "Get Out Of Jail Free" card if you have one, or
wait there for three turns, rolling the dice on each turn to try
to roll a double.  If you roll a double on any turn, move out
of Jail using this dice roll.

4

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 5

After you have waited three turns, you must move out of Jail and pay
£50 before moving your token according to your dice roll.
While in Jail you can collect rent on Properties provided they are not
mortgaged.
If you are not "sent to Jail" but, during the course of play, land on the
Jail space, you are "Just Visiting" and incur no penalty.  On your next
turn, you move ahead as usual.

Houses
Once you own all Sites of a colour-group, you can buy Houses to put
on  any  of  those  spaces.    This  increases  the  rent  you  may  charge  to
tenants.    The  price  of  a  House  is  shown  on  the  relevant  Title  Deed.
You can buy on your turn or in between other players' turns but you
must build evenly:  you cannot build a second House on any one Site
of a colour-group until you have built one House on every Site of that
group, and so on up to a maximum of four Houses per Site.  Selling
Houses must be done evenly, too.  You may buy or sell at any time,
and as many buildings as your judgement and financial standing will
allow. Houses may not be built if any Site of the same colour-group
is mortgaged. If you own all Sites of a colour-group and only one or
two of them have been built on, you can still collect double rent from
another  player  who  lands  on  one  of  your  unimproved  Sites  in  that
colour-group.

Hotels
You must have four Houses on each Site of a complete colour-group
before  you  can  buy  a  Hotel.  Hotels  are  bought  in  the  same  way  as
Houses and cost four Houses, which are returned to the Bank, plus the
price as shown on the Title Deed.
Only one Hotel may be erected on any one Site.

Building shortages
If there are no Houses left in the Bank, you must wait for other players
to return theirs before you can buy any.  Similarly, when selling Hotels
you cannot replace them with Houses if there are none left.
If a limited number of Houses or Hotels is left and two or more players
wish to buy more than the Bank has, the Banker auctions them off to
the highest bidder, starting at the lowest price shown on the relevant
Title Deed(s).

Selling Property
You may sell undeveloped Sites, Railway Stations and Utilities to any
other  player  as  a  private  transaction  for  a  sum  agreeable  to  both  of
you. No Site, however, may be sold to another player if any buildings
stand on any of the Sites of that colour-group. Should you wish to sell
a Site from a colour-group, you must first sell all buildings on those
Sites to the Bank.

5

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 6

Houses must be sold evenly, in the same way as they were bought
(see "Houses" above). Houses and Hotels cannot be sold to other
players.  They must be sold to the Bank at half the value stated on
the relevant Title Deed.  They may be sold at any time.
For Hotels, the Bank will pay half the cash price of the Hotel plus half
the  price  of  the  four  Houses  which  were  given  to  the  Bank  for  the
purchase of the Hotel.  All Hotels on one colour-group may be sold
at once. If necessary, Hotels can be broken back down into Houses
to  raise  money.    To  do  this,  you  can  sell  a  Hotel  to  the  Bank  and
receive in exchange four Houses as well as money for the Hotel (i.e.
half its cost). Mortgaged Property cannot be sold to the Bank, but to
other players only.

Mortgages
If you have no money left and are required to pay a debt, you can
raise money by mortgaging a Property.  If mortgaging a Site, first sell
any buildings to the Bank.  To mortgage a Property, turn its Title Deed
face down and collect from the Bank your mortgage to the value of
the amount shown on the back of the card.  When you wish to repay
your mortgage you must pay this amount plus 10% interest.
If  you  mortgage  a  Property,  you  retain  possession  of  it.    No  other
player can secure it by paying off the mortgage to the Bank.
Rent cannot be collected on a mortgaged Property although it can still
be collected for other Properties of that colour-group.
You can sell mortgaged Property to other players at any agreed price.
The buyer can then decide to remove the mortgage immediately by
paying off the mortgage plus the 10% interest.  Alternatively, he can
pay  the  10%  but  retain  the  Property  with  a  mortgage.    In  this  case,
when the mortgage is finally removed an additional 10% is payable.
When all Sites of a colour-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner
may begin to buy back Houses at full price.

Bankruptcy
If you owe the Bank or another player more money than you can raise
from your assets, you are declared bankrupt and are out of the game.
If your debt is to the Bank, the Bank gains all your cash and Title Deeds.
The Banker then auctions off each Property to the highest bidder.
You  must  return  "Get  Out  Of  Jail  Free"  cards  to  the  bottom  of  the
relevant pile.
If you are made bankrupt by another player, your Houses and Hotels
are sold to the Bank at half their original cost and that player receives
any cash, Title Deeds and "Get Out Of Jail Free" cards you own.  If you
own  any  mortgaged  Property,  you  must  also  turn  this  over  to  that
player;  he  must  immediately  pay  10%  and  then  choose  whether  to
retain the mortgage or pay it off in full now.

Notes on play
If  you  owe  more  rent  than  you  can  pay  in  cash,  you  may  pay  your
creditor  part  in  cash  and  part  in  Property  (Building  Sites  must  be

6

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 7

empty).  In  this  case,  the  creditor  may  choose  to  accept  certain
Property (even if it is mortgaged) at a value far in excess of the printed
one in order to obtain additional Properties or to block another player
from obtaining control of that Property.

If  you  own  Property,  it  is  up  to  you  to  watch  out  for  rents  to  be
collected.

Money can only be loaned to a player by the Bank and then only by
mortgaging property.

No player may borrow money from or lend money to another player.

Winning
The last player left in the game is the winner.

RULES FOR A SHORT GAME

There are three differences in rules for this "Short Game."

1. During PREPARATION for play the Banker shuffles the deck of Title
Deed cards.  The player to the left of the Banker then cuts the deck
and the Banker deals, one at a time, two Title Deeds to each player
(including  himself  if  he  both  plays  and  acts  as  Banker).    Players
receiving Title Deeds must immediately pay the Bank the printed price
of each of the two properties thus acquired.  Play then starts as in the
standard game.

2.  In  this  short  game  you  need  build  only  three  Houses  (instead  of
four) on each Site of a complete colour-group before buying a Hotel.

Rent received for a Hotel remains the same as in the standard game.
When  selling  Hotels,  the  value  is  still  one-half  the  purchase  price,
which in this game is one House less than in the regular game.

3.  END  OF  GAME.    The  first  player  to  go  bankrupt  retires  from  the
game as in the standard game.  However, as soon as a second player
goes bankrupt, the game ends.  The bankrupt player turns over to his
creditor  (either  the  Bank  or  another  player)  all  that  he  has  of  value,
including buildings and any properties.

Each remaining player then adds together:
1 cash in hand;
2 Sites, Utilities and Stations owned by him at the price printed on

the board;

3 any  mortgaged  property  owned  by  him  at  one-half  of  the  price

printed on the board;

4 Houses, valued at purchase price;

7

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 8

5 Hotels,  valued  at  the  purchase  price  including  the  value  of  the

three Houses exchanged.

The richest player wins!

TIME LIMIT GAME
Here's another short game you can try.  Before starting, agree upon a
definite  time  to  finish  the  game,  with  the  richest  player  at  this  time
winning.  Before starting the game, Title Deed cards are shuffled and
cut, and the Banker deals two to each player.  Players immediately pay
the  Bank  the  price  of  Property  dealt  to  them  and  play  continues  as
with the standard game.

PLAY IT RIGHT!

Many players like to devise their own ‘house’ MONOPOLY
rules. This is fine, but such rules often make the game last
longer. In the official rules players may never loan each
other money or trade ‘promises’ not to charge rent in the
future, etc. All tax and penalty fees are payable to the
Bank and should not be stored under the Free Parking

space or anywhere else!

SPEED PLAY RULES

RULES for a SHORT GAME (60-90 minutes)

There are four changed rules for this first Short Game.

1.  During PREPARATION, the Banker shuffles then deals

three Title Deed cards to each player. These are Free.

No payment to the Bank is required.

2.  You need only three Clubhouses (instead of four) on

each property of a complete color group before you

may buy a Playground. Playground rent remains the

same. The turn-in value is still one-half of  the purchase

value, which in this game is one Clubhouse less than in

the regular game.

3.  If you land in Jail you must exit on your next turn by

(1) using a “Get Out of Jail Free” card if you have (or can

buy) one;  (2) rolling doubles; or (3) paying $50. Unlike

the standard rules, you may try to roll doubles and,

failing to do so, pay the $50 on the same turn.

We will be happy to hear your questions or comments about this game.

1: AN UNOWNED PROPERTY
There are three types of properties:

South Park
Locations

Transports Mephesto’s Genetic

Engineering Ranch
& Tynacorp

You can buy the property you land on for the listed
price on the board space. Pay the Bank, then take the
Title Deed card that matches the property and place
it near you, face up.

ON YOUR TURN
1.  roll the two dice.
2.  Move your token clockwise around
the board the number of spaces
shown on the dice.

3.  You will need to take action depending

on which space you land on.
See Where Did You
Land? below.
4.  If your move

5.  If you rolled a double, roll the
dice again and take another
move (steps 1-4).

took you onto
or past the
GO space,
collect $200
from the Bank.

If you don’t want to pay the
listed price, the property goes
up for auction.
When buying property you
should plan to acquire groups.

For example:
if you buy a green location, you
should try to get the other two
green locations during the game.
Owning groups earns you more
rent when other players land on
them and lets you build on your
location for even bigger profits.

2: A PROPERTY OWNED BY ANOTHER PLAYER
If you land on another player’s property you must pay rent to
them as shown on the Title Deed card. You do not pay rent if
the property is mortgaged (its Title Deed is face down).
Important: the owner must ask you for the rent before the
player to your left rolls the dice. If they forget to ask, you don’t
have to pay!

loCATIoNS
The rent for an unimproved location is printed on the
matching Title Deed card. This is doubled if the owner owns all
locations in its color group and none of them are mortgaged.
If the location is improved with Clubhouses or Playgrounds, the
rent will be much higher – as shown on the Title Deed card.

mortgaged property, even if they don’t want to pay

off the mortgage yet.

Q: How do I get out of Jail?

A:  You’ve got 3 options…

must either repay it immediately or just

k

pay 10% of the listed value and keep the card face down;

happens. Make sure you put your

token on the JUST VISITING section.

BANKRUPT and out of the game!

◆  Pay whatever money you were able to raise.

◆  If the debt is to another player – give them all your
mortgaged properties and any Get Out of Jail Free
cards. The player must pay 10% interest on each
mortgaged property, even if they don’t want to pay

off the mortgage yet.

◆  If your debt is to the Bank – all your mortgaged

properties must be put up for auction. These are sold
unmortgaged (face up). return any Get Out of Jail
Free cards to the bottom of the appropriate piles.

1: COLLECT RENT
If another player lands on one of your unmortgaged
properties, you can demand rent from them as shown on the
Title Deed – see Property Owned by Another player below.

2: AUCTION
The Banker holds an auction when…
◆  A player lands on an unowned
property and decides not to
buy it for the listed price.

SPEED PLAY RULES

RULES for a SHORT GAME (60-90 minutes)

There are four changed rules for this first Short Game.

1.  During PREPARATION, the Banker shuffles then deals

three Title Deed cards to each player. These are Free.

No payment to the Bank is required.

2.  You need only three Clubhouses (instead of four) on

each property of a complete color group before you

may buy a Playground. Playground rent remains the

same. The turn-in value is still one-half of  the purchase

value, which in this game is one Clubhouse less than in

the regular game.

3.  If you land in Jail you must exit on your next turn by

(1) using a “Get Out of Jail Free” card if you have (or can

buy) one;  (2) rolling doubles; or (3) paying $50. Unlike

the standard rules, you may try to roll doubles and,

failing to do so, pay the $50 on the same turn.

END OF GAME:  The game ends when one player goes

bankrupt. The remaining players add up their: (1) Dollars on

hand; (2) properties owned, at the value printed on the

board; (3) any mortgaged properties owned, at one-half the

value printed on the board; (4) Clubhouses, counted at the

purchase value; (5) Playgrounds, counted at purchase value

including the amount for the three Clubhouses turned in.

The most powerful player wins!

PLAY IT RIGHT!

Many players like to devise their own ‘house’ MONOPOLY

rules. This is fine, but such rules often make the game last

longer. In the official rules players may never loan each

other money or trade ‘promises’ not to charge rent in the

future, etc. All tax and penalty fees are payable to the

Bank and should not be stored under the Free Parking

space or anywhere else!

RULES for a SHORT GAME (60-90 minutes)
There are four changed rules for this first Short Game.
1.  During PREPARATION, the Banker shuffles then deals
three Title Deed cards to each player. These are Free.
No payment to the Bank is required.

2.  You need only three Clubhouses (instead of four) on
each property of a complete color group before you
may buy a Playground. Playground rent remains the
same. The turn-in value is still one-half of  the purchase
value, which in this game is one Clubhouse less than in
the regular game.

3.  If you land in Jail you must exit on your next turn by
(1) using a “Get Out of Jail Free” card if you have (or can
buy) one;  (2) rolling doubles; or (3) paying $50. Unlike
the standard rules, you may try to roll doubles and,
failing to do so, pay the $50 on the same turn.

END OF GAME:  The game ends when one player goes
bankrupt. The remaining players add up their: (1) Dollars on
hand; (2) properties owned, at the value printed on the
board; (3) any mortgaged properties owned, at one-half the
value printed on the board; (4) Clubhouses, counted at the
purchase value; (5) Playgrounds, counted at purchase value
including the amount for the three Clubhouses turned in.
The most powerful player wins!

PLAY IT RIGHT!
Many players like to devise their own ‘house’ MONOPOLY
rules. This is fine, but such rules often make the game last
longer. In the official rules players may never loan each
other money or trade ‘promises’ not to charge rent in the
future, etc. All tax and penalty fees are payable to the
Bank and should not be stored under the Free Parking
space or anywhere else!

Monopoly/Official Rules

This section of the Monopoly wikibook will detail the official rules of the game. The object of the game
is to drive all of your opponents into bankruptcy.

Setup

To prepare the game:

The board is laid out on the playing surface.
The Chance and Community Chest card decks are
shuffled and laid face down on their designated
positions on the board.
One player is selected to be the Banker. The Banker
will manage the Bank's assets – dealing out title
deeds, bonus money and buildings to players,
collecting taxes and penalty money, and conducting
auctions. The Banker may participate in the game if
they want to, but they must keep their personal
assets separate from the Bank's assets at all times.
Each player selects a token and places it on GO.

The game starts at Go.

Each player is dealt  1,500: two  500 notes, four  100 notes, one  50 note, one  20 note,
two  10 notes, one  5 note and 5  1 notes. The exact distribution may differ between
editions.
Each player rolls the dice. The player with the highest total takes the first turn. In the event
of a tie, roll again.

Basic Gameplay

A player's turn consists of that player rolling the dice and moving their token clockwise that many spaces
around the board. Then, the player undertakes an action corresponding to the type of space they landed
on. Then, their turn ends and play passes to the next player clockwise from them.

If a player rolls doubles (the same value on both dice), then after they have resolved the action for the
space  they  landed  on  they  are  allowed  to  roll  the  dice  again  and  take  an  additional  turn.  If  they  roll
doubles  a  second  consecutive  time,  they  are  allowed  to  take  a  second  additional  turn.  However,  if  the
player rolls doubles a third consecutive time they are "caught speeding" – they must go directly to Jail,
and their turn is over.

₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩Types of Spaces

There are two broad types of spaces in Monopoly – properties and action spaces.

Properties

There are 28 properties in the game, each of which has a title deed card associated with it, detailing rent,
building cost and mortgage value. The properties are divided as follows:

Streets are the most numerous property – there are 22 streets in the game. Each street
belongs to a colour set alongside one or two other streets. Starting from GO and
proceeding clockwise, the colour sets are brown (purple in earlier editions), light blue, pink,
orange, red, yellow, green and dark blue. Each street space has a coloured bar along the
top indicating what colour set that street belongs to – this bar is also present on the title
deed.
There are four railroads (also known as stations) located at the centre of each side of the
board.
Finally, there are two utilities, the Electric Company and the Water Works. The Electric
Company is in between St. Charles Place/Pall Mall and States Avenue/Whitehall, while the
Water Works is in between Ventnor Avenue/Coventry Street and Marvin Gardens/Piccadilly.

Action Spaces

There are 12 action spaces, organised as follows:

Six card spaces, which are divided into three Chance spaces and three Community
Chest spaces.
Two tax spaces, Income and Luxury.
The four corner spaces, which are GO, Jail, Free Parking and Go to Jail.

Landing on Spaces

When a player lands on a space, they take an action determined by the type of space they landed on:

If the player lands on an unowned property, they may choose to either buy the property or
put it up for auction.

If the player chooses to buy the property, they pay the property's price, which is listed at
the bottom of its space, to the Bank. Then the Banker gives them the property's title
deed, which the new owner displays face up in front of them to designate that they own
the property.
If the player chooses not to buy the property, the property is put up for auction by the
Banker, where each player (including the player who deferred buying the property)
attempts to out-bid their opponents. Bidding starts at  10 and may be increased by
increments of as little as  1. Also, bidding does not have to follow turn order. Each
player must make a bid that is  1 higher than the previous bid. Once bidding has
reached a high enough amount that no-one wants to bid any further, the player who
made the highest bid wins the property for the agreed price. They pay the agreed price

₩₩₩to the Bank and receive the title deed. Also, if no-one wants to bid on the property, the
property remains unsold and the title deed remains with the Bank.

If the player lands on a property that is owned by another player, the owner must ask
them for rent.

If the owner asks for rent, the lander must pay the owner rent. The amount of money
paid will be stated by the title deed:

For streets, rent is influenced by the street's monopoly status, development level and
mortgage status.
For railroads/stations, rent is determined by how many railroads/stations the owner
owns – one railroad/station gives a rent of  25, two railroads/stations  50, three
100 and all four  200.
For utilities, the total of the dice is multiplied by a number to give the rent amount. If
the owner owns one utility the dice total is multiplied by four, and if the owner owns
both utilities the dice total is multiplied by ten.

If the owner fails to ask for rent before the next player in turn order rolls the dice, the
lander does not have to pay.

If the player lands on a Chance or Community Chest space, they must draw the top card
from the appropriate deck. Then they follow the card's instructions, which will either involve
paying or losing money or moving to a specific space. Once the instructions have been
carried out, the card is returned to the bottom of the appropriate deck.

The exceptions are the Get Out of Jail Free cards, of which there is one in each deck. If
the player draws a Get Out of Jail Free card, they must keep it face up in front of them
until they are ready to use or trade it.

If the player lands on a tax space, they must pay the appropriate amount to the Bank.

In earlier versions of the game, a player who landed on Income Tax was given one of
two choices – they could pay  200 as with later editions, or they could calculate 10% of
their total net worth in buildings, cash and properties and pay that. Once locked in the
choice was final – no leeway was given to reverse an unwise choice. The 10% option
was eliminated in the September 2008 graphic redesign of the game.

If the player lands on Free Parking, Jail or a property that they own, nothing happens.
The player will move from these spaces on their next turn.

If the player lands on Jail as part of a normal turn, they place their token in the "Just
Visiting" section of the space. They are unhindered and may move from Jail on their next
turn.

If the player lands on or passes GO, they receive a  200 salary from the Bank.
Finally, if the player lands on Go to Jail, they must move their token to the "In Jail" section
of the Jail space immediately. They move directly into Jail, so they do not pass GO and do
not collect a salary, and their turn is over.

Jail

A player will be sent to Jail if:

They land on the Go to Jail space.
They draw a Chance or Community Chest card that instructs them to "Go to Jail".
They roll doubles three consecutive times on the dice.

₩₩₩₩₩₩As already stated in the property actions heading above, If the
player lands on Jail as part of a normal turn, they place their
token  in  the  "Just  Visiting"  section  of  the  space.  They  are
unhindered and may move from Jail on their next turn.

Whilst  a  player  is  in  Jail,  they  will  be  unable  to  move.
However,  they  may  still  take  part  in  other  actions,  such  as
buying  and  selling  buildings,  taking  part  in  auctions,
collecting rent and trading.

In order to get out of Jail, a player has three options:

A piece in Jail. Passing pieces stay off
the "In Jail" section in orange.

Pay a  50 fine, then roll and move as normal.
Use a Get Out of Jail Free card. The card is
returned to the bottom of the appropriate deck, then the player rolls and moves as normal.
The player may roll the dice. If they roll a double, they are released from Jail. They will use
the roll to move, but unlike a normal double they will not be allowed to roll again. If the
player does not roll a double, they remain in Jail.

If the player fails to roll a double by their third turn in Jail, then if the third roll is not a double the player
will be forced to pay  50. Then they use the roll to move.

Buying Buildings

If  a  player  owns  all  of  the  streets  in  a  colour  set,  they  have  a  monopoly  on  that  colour  set.  Rent  on
unimproved properties in that colour set will be doubled, and that player may start buying buildings on
streets  in  that  colour  set  to  increase  the  rent,  provided  none  of  the  properties  in  that  colour  set  are
mortgaged (which will be explained later).

Buildings may only be built on streets – not on railroads/stations or utilities.

There are two types of buildings in Monopoly: houses and hotels. Houses, which are coloured green, are
always built first, followed by hotels, which are coloured red. A player may build buildings at any time
they like – they do not have to wait for their turn. The prices of houses and hotels are listed on the street's
title deed -  50 for the browns and light blues,  100 for the pinks and oranges,  150 for the reds and
yellows and  200 for the greens and dark blues.

If a player wants to build a house on a street, they pay the amount listed on the street's title deed and take
a house from the Bank, which they place on the colour strip running along the top of the street's board
space.

Players must build evenly – if one street in the colour set has a house, a second house may not be built
until  houses  have  been  built  on  the  other  streets.  Likewise,  a  street  with  two  houses  may  not  receive  a
third until all of the streets in the colour set have two houses, and so on.

The maximum number of houses that may be placed on a street is four. After that, if all of the streets in
that colour set have four houses, the player may pay to upgrade the houses to a hotel. The player pays the
appropriate  amount,  then  returns  the  four  houses  to  the  Bank  and  places  a  hotel  on  the  street's  colour
strip. Once a street has a hotel it may not be improved further.

₩₩₩₩₩₩There are 32 houses and 12 hotels available from the Bank. If there are no houses left in the Bank, no
player will be able to purchase new houses until houses are freed up, either from being upgraded to hotels
or being sold. However, if a player has sufficient funds they may elect to upgrade a property directly to a
hotel if they so wish. If no hotels are left in the Bank, then four-house groups may not be upgraded until
new hotels become available.

The fact that players may buy buildings at any time may result in a situation where multiple players want
to  buy  the  last  of  a  particular  building.  If  this  happens,  the  building(s)  in  question  will  be  put  up  for
auction, the auction working the same way as with a property auction.

Trading

A trade consists of a deal in which two players exchange some of their assets.

A player may propose a trade with another player at any point in the game, even when it is not their turn.
There are three assets that may be involved in a trade – money, properties and Get Out of Jail Free cards.
The amount traded is decided by the players making the deal.

If a player wishes to trade a street, any buildings on that street's colour set must be sold beforehand.

The  player  who  has  been  offered  the  trade  may  accept,  reject,  or  propose  a  counter-offer  on  their  own
terms.

Trades may not be used to loan or gift players money.

Help! I Can't Pay!

If a player finds that they owe money but do not have enough physical money to pay the debt, they will
need to raise money to pay the debt. This can be done by selling buildings and mortgaging properties.

Selling Buildings

If a player wants to sell a building, they return the building to the Bank and collect the sale price, which is
half of the initial purchase price for buildings in that colour set. Selling a hotel will immediately replace it
with four houses. And like with buying buildings, buildings must be sold evenly across the colour set.

Mortgaging Properties

A player may mortgage a property once all of the buildings in its colour set have been sold. To mortgage,
the  property's  title  deed  is  flipped  over,  revealing  the  "mortgaged"  side,  and  the  player  collects  the
mortgage value from the Bank. Whilst a property is mortgaged rent cannot be collected on it. However,
mortgaged streets in a monopoly do not prevent the unimproved unmortgaged properties in that colour set
from charging double rent. The boosted rent from owning multiple railroads/stations or utilities may be
collected in the same manner even if some of those properties are mortgaged.

A  player  may  unmortgage  a  property  later  if  they  have  sufficient  funds. To  unmortgage  a  property,  the
player  pays  back  the  mortgage  value  +  10%  interest  and  flips  the  title  deed  back  over  to  its
"unmortgaged" side.

If  a  player  receives  a  mortgaged  property  through  a  trade  or  by  bankrupting  someone,  they  must
immediately choose between unmortgaging the property or only paying the 10% interest and leaving the
property mortgaged.

Bankruptcy and the End of the Game

If a player is in the very unfortunate situation where they have sold all of their buildings and mortgaged
all  of  their  properties,  and  still  do  not  have  enough  money  to  pay  a  debt,  that  player  is  bankrupt,  and
they are out of the game. Their token is removed from the board, and what happens next depends on who
bankrupted them:

If the player was bankrupted by another player, the debtor must immediately turn over all of
their remaining assets to the creditor - money, properties and Get Out of Jail Free cards. If
mortgaged properties are among these assets, the creditor will immediately have to decide
to unmortgage the properties or keep the mortgages (which, if they are unlucky, could result
in them going bankrupt too).
If the player was bankrupted by the Bank (e.g. via a tax they do not have the money to pay),
the Bank will seize all of the debtor's assets – Any mortgaged properties have their
mortgages cancelled, any money is returned to the Bank and any Get Out of Jail Free cards
are returned to the bottom of the appropriate decks. Then, the Bank will auction off all the
properties it has seized.

The game ends once all but one player is bankrupt – that player is the winner.

Short and Timed Games

Short Game

The official Monopoly rules allow for a "short game" to be played if the players so want. A short game
uses five alterations to the rules to speed up the progression of the game, as follows:

During preparation of the game, the Banker shuffles the title deeds and deals two deeds to
each player. These deeds are free - no payment is required.
A player will only need to buy three houses on a street before they may upgrade to a hotel.
The sale price is still half of the purchase price.

If the version of Monopoly being used offers the 10% option for Income Tax, then a flat  200
tax is imposed.
If a player is sent to Jail, they must exit on their next turn by any of the standard methods. If
they try to roll doubles and fail, they must pay  50.
The game ends once one player is bankrupted. After that player's assets are turned over to
the creditor, the remaining players count up their net worth, which consists of:

their cash on hand
all unmortgaged properties owned at the price printed on the board

₩₩all mortgaged properties owned at one-half of the price printed on the board
all houses valued at purchase price
all hotels valued at purchase price plus the value of the houses turned in

The richest player wins.

Timed Game

Another way to shorten Monopoly is to play a timed game. Before beginning play the players agree to a
set length of time to play. Once this time elapses the game ends and the richest player wins.

The only alteration made to the rules is that during preparation of the game, the Banker shuffles the title
deeds and deals two deeds to each player. The players must immediately pay the price of these properties
to the Bank.

Other Notes

The Bank cannot go bankrupt. If the Bank runs out of money, the Banker may issue as
much as needed by writing on any ordinary paper.

1: AN UNOWNED PROPERTY
There are three types of properties:

South Park
Locations

Transports Mephesto’s Genetic

Engineering Ranch
& Tynacorp

You can buy the property you land on for the listed
price on the board space. Pay the Bank, then take the
Title Deed card that matches the property and place
it near you, face up.

ON YOUR TURN
1.  roll the two dice.
2.  Move your token clockwise around
the board the number of spaces
shown on the dice.

3.  You will need to take action depending

on which space you land on.
See Where Did You
Land? below.
4.  If your move

5.  If you rolled a double, roll the
dice again and take another
move (steps 1-4).
  Watch out! If you roll

doubles 3 times on the
same turn, you must
Go to Jail.

6.  When you finish your move and

action, pass the dice to the player on your left.

took you onto
or past the
GO space,
collect $200
from the Bank.

If you don’t want to pay the
listed price, the property goes
up for auction.
When buying property you
should plan to acquire groups.

For example:
if you buy a green location, you
should try to get the other two
green locations during the game.
Owning groups earns you more
rent when other players land on
them and lets you build on your
location for even bigger profits.

2: A PROPERTY OWNED BY ANOTHER PLAYER
If you land on another player’s property you must pay rent to
them as shown on the Title Deed card. You do not pay rent if
the property is mortgaged (its Title Deed is face down).
Important: the owner must ask you for the rent before the
player to your left rolls the dice. If they forget to ask, you don’t
have to pay!

loCATIoNS

3: BUILD

When you own all the locations in a color group, you can buy
Clubhouses/Playgrounds from the Bank and put them on

any of those locations.

i  The listed price of each Clubhouse is shown on

the location’s Title Deed.

ii  You must build evenly. You cannot build a second

Clubhouse on a location until you have built one on each

location of its color group.

location.

exchange them for a Playground by paying the listed
price on the Title Deed. You can only have one

Playgrounds left in the Bank, you must wait for other players to sell
theirs before you can buy any. If Clubhouses/Playgrounds are
limited and two or more players wish to buy them, the Banker must
auction them off to the highest bidder.

4: SELL CLUBHOUSES/PLAYGROUNDS
Buildings can be sold back to the Bank at half the listed price.
Buildings must be sold evenly in the same way that they were
bought. Playgrounds are sold for half the listed price and
immediately exchanged for 4 Clubhouses.

5: MORTGAGE PROPERTIES
If you’re low on cash or don’t have enough to pay
a debt, you can mortgage any of your unimproved
properties. You must sell all Clubhouses/Playgrounds
on a color group to the Bank before you can
mortgage one of its locations.

Q: How do I get out of Jail?
A:  You’ve got 3 options…
i  Pay $50 at the start of your next turn, then roll and

move as normal.

ii  Use a Get Out of Jail Free card if you have one or buy
one from another player. Put the card to the bottom of
the appropriate pile, then roll and move.

iii  Wait three turns. On each turn roll the dice; if you get
a double, move out of Jail and around the board using
this roll. If you do not get a double on your third roll,
you must pay $50 to the Bank, then move the number
of spaces rolled.

To mortgage a property turn its Title Deed card face down
and collect the listed value (shown on the back of the card)
from the Bank. To repay a mortgage, pay the listed value
plus 10% to the Bank then turn the card face up. rent cannot
be collected on mortgaged properties.

6: DO A DEAL
You can do a deal with another player to buy or sell
unimproved property. You must sell all buildings on a color
group to the Bank before you can sell one of its locations.
Property can be traded for any combination of cash, other
property or Get Out of Jail Free cards. The amount is
decided by the players making the deal.
Mortgaged property can be sold to
another player at any agreed price.
After buying a mortgaged property, you
must either repay it immediately or just
pay 10% of the listed value and keep the card face down;
if you later decide to repay to the bank the mortgage, you
will have to pay the 10% fee again.

k

Remember: your aim is not just to get rich. To win you
must make every other player BANKRUPT!

6: JAIL (JUST VISITING)
Don’t worry! If you finish your normal
move on the Jail space, nothing
happens. Make sure you put your
token on the JUST VISITING section.

7: FREE
PARKING
relax! Nothing bad
(or good) happens.

8: A PROPERTY THAT YOU OWN
Nothing happens. But you’re not
making any money!

SPEED PLAY RULES

RULES for a SHORT GAME (60-90 minutes)

There are four changed rules for this first Short Game.

1.  During PREPARATION, the Banker shuffles then deals

three Title Deed cards to each player. These are Free.

No payment to the Bank is required.

2.  You need only three Clubhouses (instead of four) on

each property of a complete color group before you

may buy a Playground. Playground rent remains the

same. The turn-in value is still one-half of  the purchase

value, which in this game is one Clubhouse less than in

the regular game.

3.  If you land in Jail you must exit on your next turn by

(1) using a “Get Out of Jail Free” card if you have (or can

buy) one;  (2) rolling doubles; or (3) paying $50. Unlike

the standard rules, you may try to roll doubles and,

failing to do so, pay the $50 on the same turn.

END OF GAME:  The game ends when one player goes

bankrupt. The remaining players add up their: (1) Dollars on

hand; (2) properties owned, at the value printed on the

board; (3) any mortgaged properties owned, at one-half the

value printed on the board; (4) Clubhouses, counted at the

purchase value; (5) Playgrounds, counted at purchase value

including the amount for the three Clubhouses turned in.

The most powerful player wins!

PLAY IT RIGHT!

Many players like to devise their own ‘house’ MONOPOLY

rules. This is fine, but such rules often make the game last

longer. In the official rules players may never loan each

other money or trade ‘promises’ not to charge rent in the

future, etc. All tax and penalty fees are payable to the

Bank and should not be stored under the Free Parking

space or anywhere else!

Monopoly Rules

HISTORY… PARKER BROTHERS Real Estate Trading Game MONOPOLY© was invented during the Great Depression by Charles
B. Darrow of Germantown Pennsylvania. Mr. Darrow, like. many other Americans, was unemployed at the time and he worked out the
details of the game primarily to amuse himself during this period. Prior to the Depression, Darrow and his wife vacationed in the resort
town of Atlantic City, New Jersey. When it came to naming the streets on the game board, Darrow naturally adopted those of his favorite
vacation spot.
The first games were handmade. Darrow gave them to friends and sold a few through a Philadelphia department store. As the demand for
the game grew, Darrow could not keep up with the orders and arranged for Parker Brothers to take over the game.
Since 1935 when Parker Brothers acquired the rights to the game, it has become the leading proprietary game not only in the United States
but throughout the Western world. the game is published under license in twenty&SHY;five countries and in fifteen foreign languages.

OBJECT...The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling property.

EQUIPMENT...The equipment consists of a board, 2 dice, tokens 32 houses and 12 hotels. There are Chance and Community Chest
cards, a Title Deed card for each property and play money.

PREPARATION...Place the board on a table and put the Chance and Community Chest cards face-down on their allotted spaces on the
board. Each player chooses one token to represent him on his travels around the board.

Each player is given $1500 divided as follows: 2 each of $500's, $100's and $50's; 6-$20's; 5 each of $10's, $5's and $1's.
All remaining money and other equipment go to the Bank.

BANKER...Select as Banker a player who will also make a good Auctioneer. If the Banker plays in the game, he must keep his personal
funds separate from those of the Bank. When more than five persons play, the Banker may elect to act only as Banker and Auctioneer.

THE BANK...Besides the Bank's money, the Bank holds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase and use by the
players. The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells and auctions properties and hands out their proper Title Deed cards; it sells houses
and hotels to the players and loans money when required on mortgages.

The Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of all properties which it sells and auctions.

The Bank never "goes broke". If the Bank runs out of money it may issue as much more as may be needed by merely writing on any
ordinary paper.

THE PLAY... Starting with the Banker, each player in turn throws the dice. The player with the highest total starts the play. He places his
token on the corner marked "GO", throws the 2 dice and moves his token in the direction of the arrow the number of spaces indicated by
the dice. After he has completed his play, the turn to play passes to the left. The tokens remain on the spaces occupied and proceed from
that point on the player's next turn. Two or more tokens may rest on the same space at the same time.

According to the space which his token reaches, a player may be entitled to buy real estate or other properties, -or be obliged to pay rent,
pay taxes, draw a Chance or Community Chest card, "Go to Jail", etc.

If a player throws doubles he moves his token as usual the sum of the two dice and is subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to
the space on which he lands. Retaining the dice, he throws again and moves his token as before. If a player throws doubles three times in
succession, he moves his token immediately to the space marked "In Jail" (see JAIL).

"GO"...Each time a player's token lands on or passes over "GO", whether by throw of the dice or by drawing a card, the Banker pays him
$200 salary.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

However, $200 is paid only once each time around the board. If a player, passing "GO" on the throw of the dice, lands 2 spaces beyond it
on "Community Chest", or 7 spaces beyond it on "Chance", and draws the card "Advance to GO", he collects $200 for passing "GO" the
first time and another $200 for reaching it the second time by instructions on the card.

BUYING PROPERTY...Whenever a player lands on an unowned property he may buy that property from the Bank at its printed price.
He receives the Title Deed card showing ownership and places it face-up in front of him.

If he does not wish to buy the property it is sold at auction by the Banker to the highest bidder. The buyer pays to the Bank the amount of
the bid in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that property. Any player, including the one who declined the option of buying it at the
printed price, may bid. Bidding may start at any price.

PAYING RENT...When a player lands on property owned by another player the owner collects rent from him in accordance with the list
printed on the Title Deed card applying to it.

If the property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. When a property is mortgaged its Title Deed card is placed face-down in front of
the owner.

It is an advantage to hold all the Title Deeds in a color-group (i.e.: Boardwalk and Park Place, - or Connecticut, Vermont and Oriental
Avenues) because the owner may then charge double rent for unimproved properties in that color-group. This rule applies to unmortgaged
properties even if another property in that color-group is mortgaged.

It is even more of an advantage to have houses or hotels on properties because rents are much higher than for unimproved properties.

The owner may not collect his rent if he fails to ask for it before the second player following throws the dice.

"CHANCE" and "COMMUNITY CHEST"...When a player lands on either of these spaces he takes the top card from the deck indicated,
follows the instructions and returns the card face-down to the bottom of the deck.

The "Get Out of Jail Free" card is held until used and then returned to the bottom of the deck. If the player who draws it does not wish to
use it he may sell it, at any time, to another player at a price agreeable to both.

"INCOME TAX"...When a player lands on "Income Tax" he has two options: he may estimate his tax at $200 and pay the Bank, or he
may pay 10% of his total worth to the Bank. His total worth is all his cash on hand, printed prices of mortgaged and unmortgaged
properties and cost price of all buildings he owns.

The player must decide which option he will take before he adds up his total worth.

JAIL...A player lands in Jail when. . . (1.) his token lands on the space marked "Go to Jail"; (2.) he draws a card marked "Go to Jail"; (3.)
he throws doubles three times in succession.

When a player is sent to Jail he cannot collect $200 salary in that move since, regardless of where his token is on the board, he must move
it directly into Jail. A player's turn ends when he is sent to Jail.

If a player is not "sent to Jail" but in the ordinary course of play lands on that space, he is "Just Visiting", incurs no penalty, and moves
ahead in the usual manner on his next turn.

A player gets out of Jail by... (1.) throwing doubles on any of his next three turns. If he succeeds in doing this he immediately moves
forward the number of spaces shown by his doubles throw. Even though he has thrown doubles he does not take another turn; (2.) using
the "Get Out of Jail Free" card if he has it; (3.) purchasing the "Get Out of Jail Free" card from another player and playing it; (4.) paying a
fine of $50 before he rolls the dice on either of his next two turns

If the player does not throw doubles by his third turn he must pay the $50 fine. He then gets out of Jail and immediately moves forward
the number of spaces shown by his throw.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Even though he is in Jail, a player may buy or sell property, buy or sell houses and hotels and collect rents.

FREE PARKING...A player landing on this space does not receive any money, property or reward of any kind. This is just a "free"
resting place.

HOUSES...When a player owns all the properties in a color & SHY; group he may buy houses from the Bank and erect them on those
properties.

If he buys one house, he may put it on any one of those properties. The next house he buys must be erected on one of the unimproved
properties of this or any other complete color-group he may own.

The price he must pay the Bank for each house is shown on his Title Deed card for the property on which he erects the house.

The owner can still collect double rent from an opponent who lands on the unimproved properties of his complete color-group.

Following the above rules, a player may buy and erect at any time as many houses as his judgment and financial standing will allow. But
he must build evenly (i.e.: he cannot erect more than one house on any one property of any color-group until he has built one house on
every property of that group. He may then begin on the second row of houses, and so on, up to a limit of four houses to a property. For
example, he cannot build three houses on one property if he has only one house on another property of that group.).

As a player builds evenly, he must also break down evenly if he sells houses back to the Bank (SEE SELLING PROPERTY).

HOTELS...When a player has four houses on each property of a complete color-group, he may buy a hotel from the Bank and erect it on
any property of that color-group. He returns the four houses from that property to the Bank and pays the price for the hotel as shown on
the Title Deed card. Only one hotel may be erected on any one property.

BUILDING SHORTAGE...When the Bank has no houses to sell, players wishing to build must wait for some player to turn back or to
sell his houses to the Bank before building. If there are a limited number of houses and hotels available, and two or more players wish to
buy more than the Bank has, the houses or hotels must be sold at auction to the highest bidder.

SELLING PROPERTY... Unimproved properties, railroads and utilities (but not buildings) may be sold to any player as a private
transaction for any amount that the owner can get. However, no property can be sold to another player if buildings are standing on any
properties of that color-group. Any buildings so located must be sold back to the Bank before the owner can sell any property of that
color-group.

Houses and hotels may be sold back to the Bank at any time for one-half the price paid for them.
All houses on one color-group must be sold one by one, evenly, in reverse of the manner in which they were erected.
All hotels on one color-group may be sold at once. Or they may be sold one house at a time (one hotel equals five houses), evenly, in
reverse of the manner in which they were erected.

MORTGAGES...Unimproved properties can be mortgaged through the Bank at any time. Before an improved property can be mortgaged
all the buildings on all the properties of its color-group must be sold back to the Bank at half price. The mortgage value is printed on each
Title Deed card.

No rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities, but rent can be collected on unmortgaged properties in the same group.
In order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the amount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When all the properties of a
color-group are no longer mortgaged the owner may begin to buy back houses at full price.

The player who mortgages property retains possession of it and no other player may secure it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank.
However, the owner may sell this mortgaged property to another player at any agreed price. The new owner may lift the mortgage at once,
if he wishes, by paying off the mortgage plus 10% interest to the Bank. If he does not lift the mortgage at once he must pay the Bank 10%

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

interest when he buys the property and if he lifts the mortgage later he must pay an additional 10% interest as well as the amount of the
mortgage to the Bank.

BANKRUPTCY...A player is bankrupt when he owes more than he can pay either to another player or to the Bank. If his debt is to
another player, he must turn over to that player all that he has of value and retire from the game. In making this settlement, if he owns
houses or hotels, he must return these to the Bank in exchange for money to the extent of one-half the amount paid for them and this cash
is given to the creditor. If he has mortgaged property he also turns this property over to his creditor but the new owner must at once pay
the Bank the amount of interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of the property. After the new owner does this, he may, at his
option, pay the principal or hold the property until some later turn at which time he may lift the mortgage. If he holds property in this way
until a later turn, he must pay the interest again when he lifts the mortgage.

Should a player owe the Bank, instead of another player, more than he can pay (because of taxes or penalties) even by selling his
buildings and mortgaging property, he must turn over all his assets to the Bank. In this case, the Bank immediately sells by auction all
property so taken, except buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the game. The last player left in the game wins.

MISCELLANEOUS...Money can only be loaned to a player by the Bank and then only by mortgaging property. No player may borrow
from or lend money to another player.

RULES for a SHORT GAME (60 to 90 minutes of fun) There are three differences in rules for this "Short Game".

1. During PREPARATION for play the Banker shuffles the pack of Title Deed cards. The pack is then cut by the player at his left and the
Banker deals, one at a time, two Title Deed cards to each player; including himself if he both plays and acts as Banker. Players receiving
Title Deed cards must immediately pay the Bank the printed price of each of the two properties thus acquired. The play then commences
as in the regular game.

2. In this short game it is only necessary to have three houses (instead of four) on each lot of a complete color-group before the player may
buy a hotel.

Rent received for a hotel remains the same as in the regular game.

The turn-in value of a hotel is still one-half the purchase price, which in this game is one house less than in the regular game.

3. END OF GAME. The first player to go bankrupt retires from the game as in the regular game. However, when the second bankruptcy
occurs the game ends. Play immediately ceases with the bankrupt player turning over to his creditor all that he has of value, including
buildings and any other properties-whether the creditor happens to be a rival player or the Bank.

Each remaining player then values his property and cash on hand (2.) lots, utilities and railroads owned by him at the price printed on the
board; (3.) any mortgaged property owned by him at one-half price printed on the board; (4.) houses, valued at purchase price; (5.) hotels,
valued at the purchase price including the value of the three houses turned in.

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 1

THE PROPERTY TRADING BOARD GAME
RULES

THE GAME IN BRIEF
MONOPOLY  is  the  game  of  buying,  renting  or  selling  Properties  so
profitably  that  players  increase  their  wealth  –  the  wealthiest
becoming the eventual winner.
Starting  from  the  "GO"  space,  move  your  token  around  the  board
according to your roll of the dice. When you land on a Property that
is not already owned by anyone else, you may buy it from the Bank. If
you do not choose to buy it, it is auctioned off to the highest bidder.
Players  who  own  Properties  collect  rents  from  opponents  stopping
there.  The  construction  of  Houses  and  Hotels  greatly  increases  the
rent  you  can  collect,  so  it  is  wise  to  build  on  as  many  Sites  as
possible.  If  you  need  to  raise  more  money,  the  Bank  can  give
mortgages on Properties. You must always obey the instructions given
on Community Chest and Chance cards. Sometimes you will be sent
to Jail.

OBJECT
To be the only player left in the game who is not bankrupt.

EQUIPMENT
1 gameboard
10 playing tokens (including 2 spares)
28 Title Deed cards
16 Chance cards
16 Community Chest cards
1 pack of MONOPOLY money
32 Houses
12 Hotels
2 dice

SET UP
1. Arrange the Houses, Hotels, Title Deeds and money (in value order)
in the separate sections of the game tray.

2. Separate the Chance and Community Chest cards, shuffle them and
put them face down in the relevant spaces on the gameboard.

3. Each player selects a playing token and places it on "GO".

1

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 2

4. The Banker and the Bank
One player is elected Banker.  If there are more than five players, the
Banker may choose to take on this role only.

The Banker gives each player £1,500 divided as follows:

Two x £500
Four x £100
One x £50
One x £20

Two x £10
One x £5
Five x £1

In addition to holding the money, the Banker also keeps the Title Deed
cards, Houses and Hotels until they are bought by the players.  The
Banker also pays salaries and bonuses, lends money when required
on mortgages and collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest.  In the
event of auctions, the Banker acts as auctioneer.
The  Bank  never  "goes  bankrupt"  but  can  issue  as  much  money  as  is
necessary in the form of IOUs written on ordinary paper.

5. Players roll both dice.  The player with the highest score goes first
and play passes to the left.

PLAYING THE GAME
On your turn, roll both dice and move clockwise around the board in
the  direction  of  the  arrow.    The  space  you  land  on  will  determine
what you have to do.  Two or more tokens may rest on the same space
at the same time.  You may do one of the following according to the
space you land on:

buy Building Sites or other Properties
pay rent by landing on an owned Property
pay taxes
draw a Chance or Community Chest card
go to Jail
rest on the Free Parking space
collect £200 salary
be “Just Visiting” Jail

Doubles
If you roll a double, move your token and act on the space you have
landed on as usual.  Roll the dice again and have another turn.  If you
roll a double for a third time in succession, you must immediately go
straight to Jail.

Passing "GO"
Every  time  you  either  land  on  or  pass  "GO"  while  moving  in  the
direction of the arrow, you are paid £200 by the Bank.  It is possible
to collect £200 twice within one turn if, for example, you land on the
Chance or Community Chest space immediately after "GO" and pick
the card that tells you to "Advance to GO".

2

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 3

Buying Property
If you land on an unowned Property (that is, on a Property for which
no other player holds the Title Deed), you have the first choice to buy
it.  There are three types of Property - Sites, Utilities and Stations. If you
decide to buy, pay the Bank the price in money stated on that space.
You will receive in exchange, as proof of ownership, that Property's
Title  Deed,  which  you  must  keep  face  up  in  front  of  you.    If  you
decide not to buy, the Banker must immediately auction the Property
for sale to the highest bidder, starting at any price that another player
is willing to pay.  Even though you declined the option of buying at
the original price, you may join in the bidding, too.

Owning Property
Owning Property entitles you to collect rent from any "tenants" who
land on that space.  It is an advantage to own all the Sites within a
colour-group — in other words to own a monopoly.  You can build
on any Site for which you own the complete colour-group.

Landing on Sites
If  you  land  on  a  Site  that  has  previously  been  bought  by  another
player,  you  may  be  required  to  pay  rent  for  stopping  there.    The
player  who  owns  this  Site  must  ask  you  for  rent  before  the  player
following  you  rolls  the  dice.    The  amount  payable  is  shown  on  the
Title  Deed  for  that  Site  and  will  vary  according  to  the  number  of
buildings  on  it.    If  all  Sites  within  a  colour-group  are  owned  by  a
player, the rent payable is doubled on any Site of that group not yet
built on.  However, an owner who owns a whole colour-group may
not  collect  double  rent  if  any  one  Site  there  is  mortgaged.    Where
Houses or Hotels have been built on a Site, the rent will increase and
will  be  shown  on  that  Site's  Title  Deed.    Rent  is  not  payable  on
mortgaged Properties.

Landing on Utilities
Landing on one of these allows you to buy the Utility if it is not already
owned.    As  with  the  other  Property  spaces,  pay  the  Bank  the  price
stated  on  that  space.    If  the  Utility  is  already  owned,  you  may  be
asked to pay rent to the owner according to the dice you rolled to get
there.  If the owner has only one of the Utilities, the rent will be four
times your dice roll.  If, however, both Utilities are owned by the same
player, you must pay ten times the amount of your dice roll.
If you decide not to buy, the Banker auctions the Utility for sale to the
highest bidder.  You may join in the bidding, too.

Landing on Stations
If you are the first to land here, you have the opportunity to buy the
Station.    Otherwise  it  is  auctioned  by  the  Bank;  even  though  you
declined to buy at the original price, you may join the bidding, too.
If  the  Station  is  already  owned  when  you  arrive,  you  must  pay  the

3

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 4

amount  stated  on  the  Title  Deed.    The  amount  payable  will  vary
according to the number of other Stations owned by that player.

Landing on "Chance" and "Community Chest"
Landing on one of these spaces means you must take the relevant card
from the top of the deck.  These cards may ask you to:

move your token
pay money – for example, in taxes
receive money
go to Jail
get out  of Jail free.

You  must  follow  the  instructions  on  the  card  and  act  immediately
before returning the card to the bottom of the deck.  If you pick a "Get
Out of Jail Free" card, you may keep it until you wish to use it or sell
it at a mutually agreed price.
Note: a card may instruct you to move your token to another space.
If  you pass "GO" on the way, collect £200.  You do not  pass "GO"
when you are sent to Jail, or if you are sent back (for example, to Old
Kent Road).

Landing on Tax spaces
When you land on these, simply pay the relevant amount to the Bank.

Free parking
If  you  land  on  this  space,  you  simply  rest  here  until  your  next  turn.
There  is  no  penalty  for  landing  here:  you  may  still  undertake
transactions  as  usual  (for  example,  collect  rent,  build  on  Sites  you
own, etc.).

Jail
You will be sent to Jail if:

you land on the "GO TO JAIL" space, or
you pick a Chance or Community Chest card which tells you
to "GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL", or
you roll a double three times in succession on your turn.

Your turn ends when you are sent to Jail.  If you are sent there, you may
not collect a £200 salary, regardless of where you are on the board.

To get out of Jail you may:

pay a fine of £50 and continue on your next turn, or
purchase a "Get Out Of Jail Free" card from another player
at a mutually agreed price and use this to get out, or
use a "Get Out Of Jail Free" card if you have one, or
wait there for three turns, rolling the dice on each turn to try
to roll a double.  If you roll a double on any turn, move out
of Jail using this dice roll.

4

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 5

After you have waited three turns, you must move out of Jail and pay
£50 before moving your token according to your dice roll.
While in Jail you can collect rent on Properties provided they are not
mortgaged.
If you are not "sent to Jail" but, during the course of play, land on the
Jail space, you are "Just Visiting" and incur no penalty.  On your next
turn, you move ahead as usual.

Houses
Once you own all Sites of a colour-group, you can buy Houses to put
on  any  of  those  spaces.    This  increases  the  rent  you  may  charge  to
tenants.    The  price  of  a  House  is  shown  on  the  relevant  Title  Deed.
You can buy on your turn or in between other players' turns but you
must build evenly:  you cannot build a second House on any one Site
of a colour-group until you have built one House on every Site of that
group, and so on up to a maximum of four Houses per Site.  Selling
Houses must be done evenly, too.  You may buy or sell at any time,
and as many buildings as your judgement and financial standing will
allow. Houses may not be built if any Site of the same colour-group
is mortgaged. If you own all Sites of a colour-group and only one or
two of them have been built on, you can still collect double rent from
another  player  who  lands  on  one  of  your  unimproved  Sites  in  that
colour-group.

Hotels
You must have four Houses on each Site of a complete colour-group
before  you  can  buy  a  Hotel.  Hotels  are  bought  in  the  same  way  as
Houses and cost four Houses, which are returned to the Bank, plus the
price as shown on the Title Deed.
Only one Hotel may be erected on any one Site.

Building shortages
If there are no Houses left in the Bank, you must wait for other players
to return theirs before you can buy any.  Similarly, when selling Hotels
you cannot replace them with Houses if there are none left.
If a limited number of Houses or Hotels is left and two or more players
wish to buy more than the Bank has, the Banker auctions them off to
the highest bidder, starting at the lowest price shown on the relevant
Title Deed(s).

Selling Property
You may sell undeveloped Sites, Railway Stations and Utilities to any
other  player  as  a  private  transaction  for  a  sum  agreeable  to  both  of
you. No Site, however, may be sold to another player if any buildings
stand on any of the Sites of that colour-group. Should you wish to sell
a Site from a colour-group, you must first sell all buildings on those
Sites to the Bank.

5

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 6

Houses must be sold evenly, in the same way as they were bought
(see "Houses" above). Houses and Hotels cannot be sold to other
players.  They must be sold to the Bank at half the value stated on
the relevant Title Deed.  They may be sold at any time.
For Hotels, the Bank will pay half the cash price of the Hotel plus half
the  price  of  the  four  Houses  which  were  given  to  the  Bank  for  the
purchase of the Hotel.  All Hotels on one colour-group may be sold
at once. If necessary, Hotels can be broken back down into Houses
to  raise  money.    To  do  this,  you  can  sell  a  Hotel  to  the  Bank  and
receive in exchange four Houses as well as money for the Hotel (i.e.
half its cost). Mortgaged Property cannot be sold to the Bank, but to
other players only.

Mortgages
If you have no money left and are required to pay a debt, you can
raise money by mortgaging a Property.  If mortgaging a Site, first sell
any buildings to the Bank.  To mortgage a Property, turn its Title Deed
face down and collect from the Bank your mortgage to the value of
the amount shown on the back of the card.  When you wish to repay
your mortgage you must pay this amount plus 10% interest.
If  you  mortgage  a  Property,  you  retain  possession  of  it.    No  other
player can secure it by paying off the mortgage to the Bank.
Rent cannot be collected on a mortgaged Property although it can still
be collected for other Properties of that colour-group.
You can sell mortgaged Property to other players at any agreed price.
The buyer can then decide to remove the mortgage immediately by
paying off the mortgage plus the 10% interest.  Alternatively, he can
pay  the  10%  but  retain  the  Property  with  a  mortgage.    In  this  case,
when the mortgage is finally removed an additional 10% is payable.
When all Sites of a colour-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner
may begin to buy back Houses at full price.

Bankruptcy
If you owe the Bank or another player more money than you can raise
from your assets, you are declared bankrupt and are out of the game.
If your debt is to the Bank, the Bank gains all your cash and Title Deeds.
The Banker then auctions off each Property to the highest bidder.
You  must  return  "Get  Out  Of  Jail  Free"  cards  to  the  bottom  of  the
relevant pile.
If you are made bankrupt by another player, your Houses and Hotels
are sold to the Bank at half their original cost and that player receives
any cash, Title Deeds and "Get Out Of Jail Free" cards you own.  If you
own  any  mortgaged  Property,  you  must  also  turn  this  over  to  that
player;  he  must  immediately  pay  10%  and  then  choose  whether  to
retain the mortgage or pay it off in full now.

Notes on play
If  you  owe  more  rent  than  you  can  pay  in  cash,  you  may  pay  your
creditor  part  in  cash  and  part  in  Property  (Building  Sites  must  be

6

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 7

empty).  In  this  case,  the  creditor  may  choose  to  accept  certain
Property (even if it is mortgaged) at a value far in excess of the printed
one in order to obtain additional Properties or to block another player
from obtaining control of that Property.

If  you  own  Property,  it  is  up  to  you  to  watch  out  for  rents  to  be
collected.

Money can only be loaned to a player by the Bank and then only by
mortgaging property.

No player may borrow money from or lend money to another player.

Winning
The last player left in the game is the winner.

RULES FOR A SHORT GAME

There are three differences in rules for this "Short Game."

1. During PREPARATION for play the Banker shuffles the deck of Title
Deed cards.  The player to the left of the Banker then cuts the deck
and the Banker deals, one at a time, two Title Deeds to each player
(including  himself  if  he  both  plays  and  acts  as  Banker).    Players
receiving Title Deeds must immediately pay the Bank the printed price
of each of the two properties thus acquired.  Play then starts as in the
standard game.

2.  In  this  short  game  you  need  build  only  three  Houses  (instead  of
four) on each Site of a complete colour-group before buying a Hotel.

Rent received for a Hotel remains the same as in the standard game.
When  selling  Hotels,  the  value  is  still  one-half  the  purchase  price,
which in this game is one House less than in the regular game.

3.  END  OF  GAME.    The  first  player  to  go  bankrupt  retires  from  the
game as in the standard game.  However, as soon as a second player
goes bankrupt, the game ends.  The bankrupt player turns over to his
creditor  (either  the  Bank  or  another  player)  all  that  he  has  of  value,
including buildings and any properties.

Each remaining player then adds together:
1 cash in hand;
2 Sites, Utilities and Stations owned by him at the price printed on

the board;

3 any  mortgaged  property  owned  by  him  at  one-half  of  the  price

printed on the board;

4 Houses, valued at purchase price;

7

Monopoly GB Instructions  5/10/00  10:24 am  Page 8

5 Hotels,  valued  at  the  purchase  price  including  the  value  of  the

three Houses exchanged.

The richest player wins!

TIME LIMIT GAME
Here's another short game you can try.  Before starting, agree upon a
definite  time  to  finish  the  game,  with  the  richest  player  at  this  time
winning.  Before starting the game, Title Deed cards are shuffled and
cut, and the Banker deals two to each player.  Players immediately pay
the  Bank  the  price  of  Property  dealt  to  them  and  play  continues  as
with the standard game.

MONOPOLY

Property Trading Game from Parker Brothers"
AGES 8+
2 to 8 Players
Contents: Gameboard, 3 dice, tokens, 32 houses, I 2  hotels, Chance
and Community Chest cards, Title Deed cards, play money and a Banker's tray.

Now there's a faster way to play MONOPOLY. Choose to play by
the classic rules for buying, renting and selling properties or use the
Speed Die to get into the action faster. If you've never played the classic
MONOPOLY game,  refer to the Classic Rules beginning on the next page.
If you already know how to play and want to use the Speed Die, just
read the section below for the additional Speed Die rules.

SPEED DIE RULES

/  fast as  playing with i't.

Learnins how to Play with the S ~ e e d  Die IS  as

1. When starting the game,  hand out an extra $1,000 to each player
(two $5005 should work). The game moves fast and you'll need
the extra cash to buy and build.

2. Do not use the Speed Die until you've landed on or passed over
GO for the first time. Once you collect that first $200 salary, you'll
use the Speed Die for the rest of the game. This means that some
players will start using the die before others.

3. Once you start using the Speed Die, roll it along with the two
white dice on your turn. Then d o  the following depending on
what you rolled.

1,  2,  or 3: Add this number to the roll of the two white
dice. You'll zoom around the board.

Bus: This lets you "get off the bus early." Look at the two white
dice. You can move the value of one die,  the other die, or the
sum of both dice. So  if you rolled a 1 and a 5,  you can move
1 space, 5 spaces, or 6 spaces: \t's your choice.
Mr. Monopoly: First,  move the sum of the two white dice
and resolve the space you land on (such as  drawing a card,
buying the property,  paying rent, etc.). Then,  one of two
things will happen depending on whether or not there is still
property in the bank.

YES,  there is property in the bank -Advance

to the NEXT

property that the bank still holds and buy it if you wish. If you
don't want to buy this property, move to the space anyway
and put the property up for auction.

NO, there are no more properties in the bank - Advance to the
NOCT property on which you will owe another player money.

A few minor details:

Only the white dice are used when determining if you rolled doubles.
Do not look at the Speed Die.

If you roll a three-of-a-kind (all of the dice show the same number),
you can move anywhere you want on the board!

If you get sent to jail during your move (either by landing on the "Go
to Jail" space or by rolling doubles three times in a row) then your turn
is over and you do not get to use the Speed Die for that turn.
Use the white dice ONLY when rolling to get out of jail.  L
Use the sum of all three dice when determining how much to pay on
a utility. Note: The Bus and Mr. Monopoly are valued at 0.

CLASSIC MONOPOW RULES
OBJECT: The object of the game IS to become the
wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling
property.
PREPARATION:  Place the board on a table and put
the Chance and Community Chest cards facedown on

their allotted spaces on the board. Each player chooses one token to
represent himther while traveling around the board.

Each player is given $1,500 divided as follows: P each of $500s,

$ 1 0 0 ~  and $ 5 0 ~ ;  6 $ 4 0 ~ ;  5 each of $105, $ 5 ~  and $Is.

All remaining money and other equipment go to the Bank. Stack the  ..

Bank's money on edge in the compartments in the plastic Banker's tray.

BANKER. Select as  Banker a player who will also
make a good Auctioneer  A  Banker who plays
~n the game must keep hislher personal funds
separate from those of the Bank. When more than
f~ve persons play, the Banker may elect to act only
as  Banker and Auctioneer.

THE BANK:  Besides the Bank's money, the Bank
holds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase
and use by the players. The  Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells
and auctions properties and hands out the~r proper Title Deed cards;
it sells houses and hotels to the players and loans money when
required on mortgages.

The Bank collects all taxes, fines,  loans and interest, and the price of

all properties which it sells and auctions.

The Bank nwer "goes broke." If the Bank runs out of money, the Banker

may issue as  much more as  needed by writing on any ordinary paper.

THE PLAY:  Starting with the Banker, each player in turn throws the dice.

The player with the highest total starts the play: Place your
token on the corner marked "GO," throw the dice and move
your token in the direction of the arrow the number of

spaces indicated by the dice. After you have completed
your play, the turn passes to the left. The tokens remain
on the spaces qccupied and proceed from that point on
the player's next turn. Two or more tokens may rest on the
same space at the same time.

According to the space your token reaches, you may be entitled to
buy real estate or other properties - or obliged to pay rent, pay taxes,
draw a Chance or Community Chest card, "Go to Jail," etc.

If you throw doubles, you move your token as  usual, the sum of the

two dice, and are subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to
the space on which you land. Retaining the dice, throw again and move
your token as  before. If you throw doubles three times in succession,
move your token immediately to the space marked "In Jail" (see JAIL).

"GO": Each time a player's token lands on or passes over
GO, whether by throwing the dice or drawing a card,
the Banker pays himther a $200 sala,ry.

The $200 is paid only once each time kound

the board. However, if a player passing GO on
the throw of the dice lands 2 spaces beyond it
on Community Chest,  or 7 spaces beyond
it on Chance, and draws the "Advance to GO" card, helshe  collects
$200 for passing GO the first time and another $200 for reaching it the
second time by instructions on the card.

BUYING PROPERTY: Whenever you land on an unowned property you
may buy that property from the Bank at  its printed price. You  receive the
Title Deed card showing ownership;  place it faceup in front of you.

If you d o  not wish to buy the property, the Banker sells it at auction
to the highest bidder. The buyer pays the Bank the amount of the bid
in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that property. Any player,
including the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed
price, may bid. Bidding may start at any price.

When you land on property owned by another player,

PAMNG
the owner collects rent from you in accordance with the list printed on
its Title Deed card.

If the property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. When a
property is mortgaged, its Title Deed card is placed facedown in front
of the owner.

L

It is an advantage to hold all the Title Deed cards in a color-

group (e.g., Boardwalk and Park Place;  or Connecticut, Vermont and
Oriental Avenues) because the owner may then charge double rent
for unimproved properties in that color-group. This rule applies to
unmortgaged properties even if another property in that color-group is
mortgaged.

It is even more advantageous to have houses or hotels on properties

because rents are much higher than for unimproved properties.

The owner may not collect the rent if he/she fails to ask  for it before

the second player following throws the dice.
"CHANCE" AND "COMMUNITY CHEST": When you land on either of
these spaces, take the top card from the deck indicated, follow the

instructions and return the card facedown to the bottom of the deck.

The "Get Out of Jail Free" card is held until used and then returned to
the bottom of the deck. If the player who draws it does not wish to use
it, helshe may sell it, at any time, to another player at a price agreeable
to both.

"INCOME TAX":  If you land here you have two options: You  may
estimate your tax at $900 and pay the Bank,  or you may pay 10% of
your total worth to the Bank. Your  total worth is all your cash on hand,
printed prices of mortgaged and unmortgaged properties and cost
price of all buildings you own.

You must decide which option you will take before you add up

your total worth.
"JAIL":  You  land in Jail when. ..(I) your token lands on the space
marked "Go to Jail"; (2) you draw a card marked "Go to JailN; or
(3) you throw doubles three times in succession.

When you are sent to Jail you cannot

collect your $200 salary in that move
since,  regardless of where your token
is on the board, you must move it
directly into Jail. Your turn ends when
you are sent to Jail.

If you are not "sent" to Jail but in the ordinary course of play land on
that space, you are "Just Visiting," you incur no penalty, and you move
ahead in the usual manner on your next turn.

You get out of Jail by.. .(I) throwing doubles on any of your next
three turns;  if you succeed in doing this you immediately move forward
the number of spaces shown by your doubles throw; even though you
had thrown doubles, you do not take another turn;  (2) using the "Get
Out of Jail Free" card if you have it;  (3)  purchasing the "Get Out of Jail
Free" card from another player and playing it;  (4)  paying a fine of $50
before you roll the dice on either of your next two turns.

If you do not throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the $50
fine. You then get out of Jail and immediately move forward the number
of spaces shown by your throw.

Even though you are in Jail,  you may buy and sell property, buy and

sell houses and hotels and collect rents.

"FREE PARKING": A player landing on this place does not
receive any money,  property or reward of any kind. This  is just a "free"
resting place.
HOUSES:  When you own all the propert~es in a color-group
you may buy houses from the Bank and erect them on those properties.

If you buy one house, you may put it on any

one of those properties. The  next house you
buy must be erected on one of the unimproved
properties of this or any other complete color-
group you may own.

The  price you must pay the Bank for each
house is shown on your l t l e  Deed card for the
property on which you erect the house.

The  owner still collects double rent from an opponent who lands on

the unimproved properties of hisher complete color-group.

Following the above rules, you may buy and erect at any time as
many houses as  your judgement and financial standing will allow. But
you must build evenly, i.e., you cannot erect more than one house on
any one property of any color-group until you have built one house on
wery property of that group. You  may then begin on the second row
of houses, and so on,  up to a limit of four houses to a property. For
example, you cannot build three houses on one property if you have
only one house on another property of that group.

As you build evenly, you must also break down evenly ifyou sell

houses back to the Bank (see SELLING PROPERTY).

HOTELS:  When a player has four houses on each property of a
complete color-group, hdshe may buy a hotel from the Bank and erect
it on any property of the color-group. Hdshe returns the four houses
from that property to the Bank and pays the price for the hotel as  shown
on the Ttle Deed card. Only one hotel may be erected on any one
property.
BUILDING SHORTAGES: When the Bank has no houses to sell,  players
wishing to build must wait for some player to return or sell histher
houses to the Bank before building. If there are a limited number of
houses and hotels available and two or more players wish to buy more
than the Bank has,  the houses or hotels must be sold at auction to the
highest bidder.

SELLING PROPERN:  Unimproved properties, railroads and util~ties
(but not buildings) may be sold to any player as a private transaction
for any amount the owner can get;  however, no property can be sold to
another player if buildings are standing on any properties of that color-
group. Any buildings so located must be sold back to the Bank before
the owner can sell any property of that color-group.

-

Houses and hotels may be sold back to the Bank at any time for one-

half the price paid for them.

All houses on one color-group must be sold one by one, evenly,  in

reverse of the manner in which they were erected.

All hotels on one color-group may be sold at once, or they may be

sold one house at a time (one hotel equals five houses), evenly,  in
reverse of the manner in which they were erected.

MORTGAGES:  Unimproved properties can be mortgaged through the
Bank at any time. Before an improved property can be mortgaged,  all
the buildings on all the properties of its color-group must be sold back
to the Bank at half price. The  mortgage value is printed on each Title
Deed card.

No rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities,

but rent can be collected on unmortgaged properties in the
same group.

In order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the
amount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When all the propert~es of
a color-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy
back houses at full price.

The player who mortgages property retains possession of it and
no other player may secure it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank.
However, the owner may sell this mortgaged property to another player
at any agreed price. If you are the new owner, you may lift the mortgage
at once if you wish by paying off the mortgage plus
10% interest to the Bank. If the mortgage is not lifted
at once, you must pay the Bank 10% interest when
you buy the property and if you lift the
mortgage later you must pay the Bank
an additional 10% interest as well

as the amount of the mortgage.  n

,

BANKRUPTCY.. You are declared bankrupt if you owe more than you
can pay either to another player or to the Bank. If your
debt is to another player, you must tum over to that
player all that you have of value and retire from the
game. In making this settlement,  if you own houses or

hotels, you must retum these to the Bank in exchange
for money to the extent of one-half the amount paid
for them;  this cash is given to the creditor. If you have
mortgaged property you also turn this property over
to your creditor but the new owner must at once pay  .
the Bank the amount of interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of
the property. The new owner who does this may then, at hislher option,
pay the principal or hold the property until some later turn,  then lift the
mortgage. If helshe holds property in this way until a later turn,  helshe
must pay the interest again upon lifting the mortgage.

Should you owe the Bank,  instead of another player, more than you
can pay (because of taxes or penalties) even by selling off buildings
and mortgaging property, you must turn over all assets to the Bank. In
this case, the Bank immediately sells by auction all property so taken,
except buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the
game. The  last player left in the game wins.

MISCEUANEOUS: Money can be loaned to a player only by the Bank
and then only by mortgaging property. No player may borrow from or
lend money to another player.
